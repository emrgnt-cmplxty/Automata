      "## Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "SymbolDocEmbeddingHandler is a class that handles the process of embedding symbols. Its core functionalities include retrieving an existing embedding for a symbol, processing the embedding for a symbol, and updating the existing embedding. Under the hood, it uses a database of symbol embeddings (JSONSymbolEmbeddingVectorDatabase) and a builder for symbol document embeddings (SymbolDocEmbeddingBuilder).\n",

      "\n",
      "## Example\n",
      "\n",
      "The following example demonstrates how to use SymbolDocEmbeddingHandler:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from automata.core.symbol_embedding.base import JSONSymbolEmbeddingVectorDatabase, SymbolDocEmbedding, SymbolEmbeddingHandler\n",
      "from automata.core.symbol_embedding.builders import SymbolDocEmbeddingBuilder\n",
      "from automata.core.symbol.base import Symbol \n",
      "\n",

      "# Create SymbolDocEmbeddingHandler instance\n",

      "Please note that \"your_symbol_string\" and other variables would be replaced according to your project.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Limitations\n",
      "\n",
      "The SymbolDocEmbeddingHandler assumes that all the symbols have source code available to be embedded. If a symbol's source code is not available, a ValueError is raised. Also, the current implementation does nothing if the symbol is already contained in the database and its source code has not changed. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Follow-up Questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "- How is the SymbolDocEmbeddingBuilder configured in a real scenario? The example uses a placeholder, but a concrete example would be helpful.\n",
      "- What are some common use cases for using the update_existing_embedding method?\n",
      "- Could you provide more clarity around what the embedding process entails and how it's utilized in general? \n",
      "- How are the generated embeddings typically used downstream? \n",
      "- Are there plans to handle the case where a symbol already exists in the database but its source code has changed more proactively? \n",
      "- How well does the current implementation scale with large numbers of symbols or large-sized symbols?Fetching related context now for 10 symbols...\n",

      "The `SymbolCodeEmbeddingHandler` is a class in the Automata framework used for storing and retrieving encoded embeddings of Python classes, methods, or local variables. Interacting with a `JSONSymbolEmbeddingVectorDatabase`, it can retrieve existing embeddings for a `Symbol` with the `get_embedding` method and make updates as necessary via the `process_embedding` method and `update_existing_embedding` functions. \n",
      "\n",
      "Though the class is dynamic, it has limitations. The embeddings it interacts with rely on the accuracy and upkeep of the `JSONSymbolEmbeddingVectorDatabase` database - if not properly maintained or updated, the embeddings may misrepresent the symbols. Further, the `SymbolCodeEmbeddingHandler` class isn't equipped to load custom databases, instead, it predetermines the structure for database files, expecting them to adhere to a particular format.\n",

Related classes exist for building these embeddings, handling the database storing them, and providing the logic for the source code symbol itself. To create an instance, a symbol, associated source code, and a numpy array for vector representation are needed. There may be certain limitations like the complexity and size of source code symbols which can affect storage and computation. Further information is needed on the dimension of numpy vectors used commonly, generation or training of these vectors from the source code, and implicit expectations in the types of symbol or source code that can be embedded.\n",

Key methods include the constructor `__init__`, which initializes the instance with the provided `embedding_db` and `embedding_builder`, and two abstract methods, `get_embedding` and `process_embedding`, which are intended to return and process the embedding for a specific symbol respectively.

      "## Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "SymbolDocEmbeddingHandler is a class that handles the process of embedding symbols. Its core functionalities include retrieving an existing embedding for a symbol, processing the embedding for a symbol, and updating the existing embedding. Under the hood, it uses a database of symbol embeddings (JSONSymbolEmbeddingVectorDatabase) and a builder for symbol document embeddings (SymbolDocEmbeddingBuilder).\n",

      "## Example\n",
      "\n",
      "The following example demonstrates how to use SymbolDocEmbeddingHandler:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from automata.core.symbol_embedding.base import JSONSymbolEmbeddingVectorDatabase, SymbolDocEmbedding, SymbolEmbeddingHandler\n",
      "from automata.core.symbol_embedding.builders import SymbolDocEmbeddingBuilder\n",
      "from automata.core.symbol.base import Symbol \n",
      "\n",
      "# Initialize database and builder\n",
      "embedding_db = JSONSymbolEmbeddingVectorDatabase('path_to_embedding_db')\n",
      "embedding_builder = SymbolDocEmbeddingBuilder(embedding_provider, symbol_search, retriever)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Create SymbolDocEmbeddingHandler instance\n",
      "embedding_handler = SymbolDocEmbeddingHandler(embedding_db, embedding_builder)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Use a sample symbol from your project\n",
      "symbol = Symbol.from_string(\"your_symbol_string\")\n",

      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note that \"your_symbol_string\" and other variables would be replaced according to your project.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Limitations\n",
      "\n",
      "The SymbolDocEmbeddingHandler assumes that all the symbols have source code available to be embedded. If a symbol's source code is not available, a ValueError is raised. Also, the current implementation does nothing if the symbol is already contained in the database and its source code has not changed. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Follow-up Questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "- How is the SymbolDocEmbeddingBuilder configured in a real scenario? The example uses a placeholder, but a concrete example would be helpful.\n",
      "- What are some common use cases for using the update_existing_embedding method?\n",
      "- Could you provide more clarity around what the embedding process entails and how it's utilized in general? \n",
      "- How are the generated embeddings typically used downstream? \n",
      "- Are there plans to handle the case where a symbol already exists in the database but its source code has changed more proactively? \n",
      "- How well does the current implementation scale with large numbers of symbols or large-sized symbols?Fetching related context now for 10 symbols...\n",

      "The `SymbolCodeEmbeddingHandler` is a class in the Automata framework used for storing and retrieving encoded embeddings of Python classes, methods, or local variables. Interacting with a `JSONSymbolEmbeddingVectorDatabase`, it can retrieve existing embeddings for a `Symbol` with the `get_embedding` method and make updates as necessary via the `process_embedding` method and `update_existing_embedding` functions. \n",
      "\n",
      "Though the class is dynamic, it has limitations. The embeddings it interacts with rely on the accuracy and upkeep of the `JSONSymbolEmbeddingVectorDatabase` database - if not properly maintained or updated, the embeddings may misrepresent the symbols. Further, the `SymbolCodeEmbeddingHandler` class isn't equipped to load custom databases, instead, it predetermines the structure for database files, expecting them to adhere to a particular format.\n",

Related classes exist for building these embeddings, handling the database storing them, and providing the logic for the source code symbol itself. To create an instance, a symbol, associated source code, and a numpy array for vector representation are needed. There may be certain limitations like the complexity and size of source code symbols which can affect storage and computation.
