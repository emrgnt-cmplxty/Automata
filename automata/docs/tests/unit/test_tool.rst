TestTool
========

``TestTool`` is a class derived from the ``Tool`` base class. Itâ€™s a
simple tool implementation that allows synchronous and asynchronous
execution of a provided function or coroutine and returns a specific
output in the form of a string. This class is mainly used for testing
purposes.

Overview
--------

As a subclass of ``Tool``, ``TestTool`` provides an implementation for
the ``_run`` and ``_arun`` methods, making it easy to execute
synchronous and asynchronous functions respectively. This class is
useful for creating simple tests using the test_tool_run function.

-  ``automata.tests.unit.test_tool.test_toolkit``

Example
-------

The following code demonstrates the creation of a ``TestTool`` instance
and how to execute its synchronous and asynchronous methods.

.. code:: python

   from automata.tests.unit.test_tool import TestTool

   test_tool = TestTool(
       name="TestTool",
       description="A test tool for testing purposes",
       func=lambda x: "TestTool response",
   )

   tool_input = ("test",)

   # Synchronous execution
   response = test_tool.run(tool_input)
   print(response)  # Output: "TestTool response"

   # Asynchronous execution
   import asyncio

   async def test_async():
       async_response = await test_tool.arun(tool_input)
       print(async_response)

   asyncio.run(test_async())  # Output: "TestTool async response"

Limitations
-----------

As it is mainly used for testing purposes, ``TestTool`` is not intended
for actual use in production environments or comprehensive applications.
Its functions are primarily for verifying that the underlying
functionalities of the ``Tool`` class and related objects are
implemented correctly, and largely serve as a utility for these specific
testing needs.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Are there any other use cases for the ``TestTool`` class beyond
   testing purposes?
