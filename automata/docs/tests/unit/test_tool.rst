TestTool
========

``TestTool`` is a simple testing tool that inherits from the ``Tool``
class. It is designed for testing purposes within the automata
framework. Its primary function is to return a predefined string when
executed. ``TestTool`` serves as an example of how to create and use
custom tools within the framework.

Overview
--------

``TestTool`` is a subclass of ``Tool`` that takes a function as input
and returns a predefined string. The class is intended for testing
purposes and demonstrates how to create and use custom tools within the
Automata framework. The ``TestTool`` class has a single method named
``run``, which takes a dictionary as input and returns a string. It also
provides an example of how to use the tool with related symbols like
``pytest.fixture`` and test functions.

Related Symbols
---------------

-  ``automata.core.tools.tool.Tool``
-  ``automata.tests.unit.test_tool.test_tool``
-  ``automata.tests.unit.test_tool.test_tool_run``
-  ``automata.tests.unit.test_tool.test_tool_instantiation``

Example
-------

The following example demonstrates how to create an instance of
``TestTool``, run the tool with provided input, and obtain the
response):

.. code:: python

   from automata.tests.unit.test_tool import TestTool
   tool_input = {"test": "test"}
   test_tool = TestTool(
       name="TestTool",
       description="A test tool for testing purposes",
       function=lambda x: "TestTool response",
   )

   response = test_tool.run(tool_input)
   print(response)  # Output: "TestTool response"

Limitations
-----------

The primary limitation of ``TestTool`` is that it is intended for
testing purposes only and does not provide any real-world functionality
or use case. Its purpose is to serve as an example of how to create and
use custom tools within the Automata framework.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  How can we create more advanced tools that interact with external
   services or process complex data?

-  What are the best practices for designing and implementing custom
   tools within the Automata framework?
