TestExecuteBehavior
===================

``TestExecuteBehavior`` is a class that implements the
``ITaskExecution`` interface for executing test tasks.

Overview
--------

``TestExecuteBehavior`` is a testing utility class used for executing
tasks in a test environment. It is a part of the automata test suite.
The class is an ``ITaskExecution`` subtype, which means it contains the
``execute()`` method responsible for executing tasks. The ``execute()``
method in ``TestExecuteBehavior`` creates a new module using the
``PyWriter`` and ``PyReader`` utilities, defines a simple function
inside it, assigns a result to the task, and cleans up the newly created
module file.

Example
-------

The following example demonstrates how to use ``TestExecuteBehavior`` to
execute a task in an Automata task executor.

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.tasks.base import Task
   from automata.core.tasks.executor import AutomataTaskExecutor
   from automata.tests.unit.test_task_executor import TestExecuteBehavior

   # define a Task
   task = Task()

   # use TestExecuteBehavior for task execution
   execution = TestExecuteBehavior()
   task_executor = AutomataTaskExecutor(execution)

   # execute the task
   result = task_executor.execute(task)

In the example above, we first instantiate a ``Task`` object. Then, we
create an instance of ``TestExecuteBehavior`` and provide it to the
``AutomataTaskExecutor``, which will execute the task using the
``TestExecuteBehavior``.

Limitations
-----------

``TestExecuteBehavior`` is primarily meant for testing and may not fully
emulate the behavior of a typical execution behavior used in production.
It generates python files and deletes them immediately after execution.
Therefore, this behavior may not be appropriate for scenarios where
persistent modification of the python filesystem is required.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  While ``TestExecuteBehavior`` serves as an excellent tool for testing
   task execution, could it benefit from more comprehensive testing
   features?
-  Would extending ``TestExecuteBehavior`` with more helper methods
   streamline testing in certain scenarios? For example, a method to
   handle and track exceptions during task execution. Is there a
   possibility to extend this class functionality?
-  Is ``TestExecuteBehavior`` suitable for integration testing, or
   should we rely on more sophisticated tooling/frameworks for
   integration tests?
