TaskEnvironment
===============

``TaskEnvironment`` is the abstract base class for an environment in the
Automata system. It provides a base structure to build specific task
environment implementations, which should include methods to reset, set
up, tear down, and validate the environment. The ``TaskEnvironment``
class focuses on ensuring consistent behavior and interfaces for all
environment implementations.

Example
-------

The following is an example demonstrating how to create a custom
implementation of the ``TaskEnvironment`` abstract base class.

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.tasks.base import TaskEnvironment
   from typing import Any

   class CustomTaskEnvironment(TaskEnvironment):
       def reset(self) -> None:
           print("Resetting the environment")

       def setup(self, task: Any) -> None:
           print(f"Setting up the environment for task {task}")

       def teardown(self) -> None:
           print("Tearing down the environment")

       def validate(self) -> None:
           print("Validating the environment")

   # Create a new instance of the CustomTaskEnvironment class
   environment = CustomTaskEnvironment()

   # Usage
   environment.reset()
   environment.setup("Example task")
   environment.teardown()
   environment.validate()

Limitations
-----------

The primary limitation is that ``TaskEnvironment`` only provides a
framework and guidelines for creating an environment. The actual
implementation of environment features depends on the concrete
implementations. For example, the ``AutomataTaskEnvironment``
implementation uses a GitHub manager for its environment setup and
tear-down processes.

Follow-up Questions
-------------------

-  How can we ensure that all concrete environment implementations have
   the necessary methods and attributes?
-  What are the potential pitfalls when extending the
   ``TaskEnvironment`` class with custom environment implementations?
