VectorDatabaseProvider
======================

``VectorDatabaseProvider`` is an abstract base class for different types
of vector database providers. These database providers are designed to
store and manage ``SymbolEmbedding`` instances, which represent the
embeddings of symbols within a given context. This class provides the
structure and common functionality for specific implementations of
vector database providers, such as ``JSONEmbeddingVectorDatabase``.

Overview
--------

``VectorDatabaseProvider`` includes abstract methods like
``calculate_similarity`` and ``get_all_symbols`` which must be
implemented by any concrete class that inherits from it. The
``calculate_similarity`` method is used to calculate the similarity
between a given embedding vector and the vectors stored in the database,
while ``get_all_symbols`` method retrieves all symbols currently stored
in the database.

Example
-------

The following example demonstrates how to create a custom database
provider that inherits from ``VectorDatabaseProvider``.

.. code:: python

   import numpy as np
   from automata.core.base.database.vector import VectorDatabaseProvider

   class MyVectorDatabaseProvider(VectorDatabaseProvider):

       def __init__(self):
           self.data = []
           
       def calculate_similarity(self, embedding_vec: np.ndarray) -> Dict[Symbol, float]:
           # Implement similarity calculation logic here
           pass

       def get_all_symbols(self) -> List[Symbol]:
           # Implement logic to retrieve all symbols here
           pass

   # Usage
   my_vector_db_provider = MyVectorDatabaseProvider()

Limitations
-----------

As an abstract base class, ``VectorDatabaseProvider`` cannot be
instantiated directly and must be subclassed by a concrete
implementation. Additionally, the specific database provider
implementation determines the storage format and efficiency of
similarity calculations, which may vary depending on the chosen
provider.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Are there any existing implementations of ``VectorDatabaseProvider``
   other than ``JSONEmbeddingVectorDatabase``?
-  How can the process of adding, updating, or removing
   ``SymbolEmbedding`` instances be optimized or customized for
   different application requirements?
-  Are any performance guarantees provided for similarity-based queries?
