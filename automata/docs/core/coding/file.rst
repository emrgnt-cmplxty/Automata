File
====

``File`` is a class representing a file in a hierarchical tree structure
and inherits from the ``Node`` base class. Its primary purpose is to
store information about a file’s ``name`` and ``parent``, where the
parent is another instance of a ``Node`` or a subclass.

Overview
--------

``File`` is a concrete implementation of the ``Node`` abstract base
class, tailored to represent files in the file tree hierarchy. It
includes two attributes: ``name`` and ``parent``, where the ``name``
represents the name of the file, and the ``parent`` represents the
parent ``Node`` instance. The class is mostly used in constructing file
trees and interacting with file tree data structures.

Usage Example
-------------

The following example demonstrates how to create an instance of the
``File`` class with a specific name and parent node.

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.navigation.directory import File, Node

   parent_node = Node("ParentNode")
   file_instance = File("File1", parent_node)

Limitations
-----------

The ``File`` class is a simplistic representation of a file in a tree
structure and mainly serves to store and access information about a
file’s name and parent properties. It does not include more advanced
features related to file handling and manipulation and cannot be used
for more complex file operations.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Are there any methods or attributes that should be added to the
   ``File`` class to make it more robust or useful?
-  Is there a need for more interaction with the underlying file system
   for the ``File`` class instances?
