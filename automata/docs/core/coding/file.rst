File
====

``File`` represents a file in a tree structure used in the
``automata.core.coding.directory`` module. This class is used to store
information about the name and parent node of a file within the file
tree. It inherits from the ``Node`` base class.

Overview
--------

``File`` provides a convenient way to store and manage information about
a file in the file tree. It provides a simple interface to set the name
and parent node of a file, which is required for constructing a
hierarchical tree representation of a file.

Usage Example
-------------

The following example demonstrates how to create an instance of a
``File`` object:

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.coding.directory import File
   from automata.core.coding.directory import Node

   file_name = "example.txt"
   parent = Node("parent")
   file = File(file_name, parent)
   print(file.name)  # Output: example.txt
   print(file.parent.name)  # Output: parent

Limitations
-----------

The primary limitation of the ``File`` class is that it represents only
a single file in the tree and does not handle the hierarchical data
structure of the file tree on its own. Additional logic is required to
build and manage a complete file tree using the ``File`` class.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Are there any ways to improve the ``File`` class to better handle
   hierarchical file tree structures?
