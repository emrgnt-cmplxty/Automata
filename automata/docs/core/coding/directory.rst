Directory
=========

``Directory`` represents a directory and is a part of a file tree
hierarchy. It has children which can be directories or files. It offers
methods to add a child node, get file names or subdirectory names, check
if itâ€™s a leaf directory or root directory, and other related
operations.

Overview
--------

The ``Directory`` class is used to represent a directory in a file tree
hierarchy. It inherits from the abstract base class ``Node`` and extends
its functionality to directories specifically. Instances of
``Directory`` can have children which can be instances of other
directories or files. ``Directory`` class offers methods to add child
nodes, get file names and subdirectory names from a directory, and check
if a directory is a leaf directory or root directory.

Import Statements
-----------------

.. code:: python

   import logging
   import os
   from typing import Dict, List, Optional

Related Symbols
---------------

-  ``automata.core.coding.directory.File``
-  ``automata.core.coding.directory.Node``
-  ``automata.core.base.database.vector.JSONEmbeddingVectorDatabase``

Example
-------

The following is an example demonstrating how to create a Directory
instance:

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.coding.directory import Directory

   root_directory = Directory("root")
   child_directory = Directory("child", parent=root_directory)
   root_directory.add_child(child_directory)

Limitations
-----------

The primary limitation of ``Directory`` is that it assumes a specific
directory structure to work with. Additionally, it does not provide any
method to directly create, delete, or move directories on the file
system. Instead, it provides a representation of a directory structure
in memory.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  How can we extend the ``Directory`` class to support file system
   operations, such as creating, deleting, or moving directories?
