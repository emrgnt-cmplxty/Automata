SymbolDescriptor
================

``SymbolDescriptor`` is a class that wraps the descriptor component of
the URI into a Python object. The descriptor is an important part of the
``Symbol`` class, which is used to identify classes, methods, or local
variables in the Automata system. ``SymbolDescriptor`` provides a
convenient interface for working with descriptors and includes closely
related symbols such as ``Symbol`` and ``DescriptorProto``.

Overview
--------

``SymbolDescriptor`` is a simple class that represents the various types
of descriptors found in the ``Symbol`` class. It contains methods for
parsing and unparsing descriptors, converting descriptor suffixes, and
other utility functions for working with descriptors. The class also
provides an implementation for the string representation of descriptors.

Related Symbols

-  ``automata.core.symbol.symbol_types.Symbol``
-  ``automata.core.symbol.scip_pb2.Descriptor``
-  ``automata.core.symbol.parser.parse_symbol``
-  ``automata.core.symbol.parser._SymbolParser.parse_descriptor``
-  ``automata.core.symbol.parser._SymbolParser.parse_descriptors``

Example
-------

The following example demonstrates how to create an instance of
``SymbolDescriptor``:

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.symbol.symbol_types import SymbolDescriptor, DescriptorProto

   name = "example_method"
   suffix = DescriptorProto.METHOD
   disambiguator = "example_disambiguator"

   descriptor = SymbolDescriptor(name, suffix, disambiguator)

   print(descriptor)  # Output: "example_method(example_disambiguator)."

Limitations
-----------

The primary limitation of ``SymbolDescriptor`` is that it assumes a
specific syntax and format for the descriptor component of the
``Symbol``. It may not work correctly if the input does not follow the
expected structure. Additionally, some of the utility methods assume
knowledge of descriptor suffixes, and their behavior may not be accurate
if new suffix types are introduced.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  How can the ``SymbolDescriptor`` class be extended to support new
   types of descriptors?
-  Can the limitations of this class be improved through refactoring or
   design changes?

Footnotes
---------

1. Note that in some tests, the ``SymbolDescriptor`` objects’ behavior
   is mocked for simplicity. If you encounter a reference to a “Mock”
   object in test files from your context, do your best to replace these
   with the actual underlying object or note this in a footnote. Mock
   objects are used in testing to simplify working with complex objects.
