SymbolDocEmbedding
==================

``SymbolDocEmbedding`` is a class representing the embedding vector
associated with a symbolâ€™s document. This class extends the
``SymbolEmbedding`` abstract base class and includes additional metadata
attributes such as the source code, summary, and contextual information
of the symbol.

Overview
--------

The primary purpose of ``SymbolDocEmbedding`` is to store the document
embedding of a symbol along with any additional information that may be
useful for retrieval or other processing tasks. This class is mainly
useful within the ``SymbolDocEmbeddingHandler``, which manages the
creation, updating, and retrieval of document embeddings for symbols.

Example
-------

The following example shows how to instantiate a ``SymbolDocEmbedding``
object with sample data:

.. code:: python

   import numpy as np
   from automata.core.symbol.symbol_types import Symbol, SymbolDocEmbedding

   symbol = Symbol.from_string("sample.symbol")
   document = "This is a sample document."
   vector = np.random.rand(300)

   symbol_doc_embedding = SymbolDocEmbedding(
       symbol=symbol,
       document=document,
       vector=vector,
       source_code="def sample_function():\n    pass",
       summary="A sample function that does nothing.",
       context="This sample function is part of a larger module of functions."
   )

Limitations
-----------

``SymbolDocEmbedding`` is primarily a data storage class and does not
contain functionality for processing or manipulation of embeddings. The
actual creation and management of document embeddings is handled by the
``SymbolDocEmbeddingHandler``. Additionally, ``SymbolDocEmbedding``
assumes that the symbol and document correspond correctly, and it does
not perform validation checks to ensure consistency.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Are there cases where ``SymbolDocEmbedding`` objects might contain
   incorrect or inconsistent data, and how can we minimize such issues?
