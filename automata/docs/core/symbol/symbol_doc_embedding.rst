SymbolDocEmbedding
==================

``SymbolDocEmbedding`` is a class that represents an embedding for
symbol documents. It extends the abstract base class ``SymbolEmbedding``
and contains additional metadata like source code, summary, and context
of the symbol.

Overview
--------

The ``SymbolDocEmbedding`` class is responsible for storing the
information about embeddings for symbol documents. It holds the source
code, summary, and context of a symbol, which can be used in various
applications like searching symbols, getting completions, updating
embeddings, and more. It is mainly utilized by
``SymbolDocEmbeddingHandler`` for managing and manipulating symbol
document embeddings.

Related Symbols

-  ``automata.core.memory_store.symbol_doc_embedding.SymbolDocEmbeddingHandler``
-  ``automata.core.symbol.scip_pb2.Descriptor``
-  ``automata.core.symbol.parser.parse_symbol``
-  ``automata.core.symbol_embedding.base.SymbolCodeEmbedding``
-  ``automata.core.symbol_embedding.base.SymbolEmbedding``

Example
-------

The following example demonstrates how to create a
``SymbolDocEmbedding`` instance.

.. code:: python

   import numpy as np
   from automata.core.symbol.parser import parse_symbol
   from automata.core.symbol.base import SymbolDocEmbedding

   symbol_str = "scip-python python automata 75482692a6fe30c72db516201a6f47d9fb4af065 `automata.core.agent.agent_enums`/ActionIndicator#"
   symbol = parse_symbol(symbol_str)
   document = "This is a sample document for the symbol."
   vector = np.array([0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9])

   embedding = SymbolDocEmbedding(symbol, document, vector)

Limitations
-----------

The primary limitation of ``SymbolDocEmbedding`` is that it only
contains information specifically catered to symbol documents, making it
unsuitable for interacting with other types of embeddings. Additionally,
the class heavily relies on the ``parse_symbol`` function and the
``Symbol`` class for correct symbol representation.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  How can ``SymbolDocEmbedding`` be extended to handle different types
   of embeddings more flexibly?
-  How can we improve the interaction between ``SymbolDocEmbedding`` and
   its related symbols?
