SymbolCodeEmbedding
===================

``SymbolCodeEmbedding`` is a class that represents an embedding of a
symbol code. It is used in various operations related to symbol
embeddings, such as retrieving and updating embeddings from databases
and providers. The section below provides a brief overview, related
symbols, usage examples, and some discussion around limitations.

Overview
--------

``SymbolCodeEmbedding`` is mainly used for representing the embedded
code of a ``Symbol`` object in the context of the automata framework. It
inherites from the ``SymbolEmbedding`` class and provides a convenient
and accessible way to store and manage symbol code embeddings.

Related Symbols

-  ``automata.core.symbol.symbol_types.Symbol``
-  ``automata.core.symbol.symbol_types.SymbolEmbedding``
-  ``automata.core.symbol.symbol_types.SymbolDocEmbedding``
-  ``automata.core.embedding.code_embedding.SymbolCodeEmbeddingHandler``

Usage Example
-------------

The following example demonstrates the creation of a
``SymbolCodeEmbedding`` for a given symbol, source code, and its
embedded vector.

.. code:: python

   import numpy as np
   from automata.core.symbol.symbol_types import Symbol, SymbolCodeEmbedding

   symbol = Symbol.from_string("some_symbol")  # The desired Symbol object
   source_code = "def function_example():\n    pass"
   vector = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3])

   embedding = SymbolCodeEmbedding(symbol, source_code, vector)

Note that this example assumes that the ``Symbol`` object already
exists. For more information about working with ``Symbol`` objects,
consult the ``automata.core.symbol.symbol_types.Symbol`` class
documentation.

Limitations
-----------

``SymbolCodeEmbedding``, by design, only represents a single symbolâ€™s
code embedding and does not provide any utilities to manipulate or
analyze embeddings themselves. Other components like
``SymbolCodeEmbeddingHandler`` and ``SymbolSimilarity`` are responsible
for handling the manipulation and evaluation of embeddings.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  What is the process to extract or update embeddings for a given
   symbol?
-  Are there any specific constraints for the provided vector
   representation in ``SymbolCodeEmbedding``?
