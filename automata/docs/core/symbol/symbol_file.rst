SymbolFile
==========

``SymbolFile`` is a class that represents a file that contains a symbol.
It is used to store information about the file path where a symbol is
located. This class provides equality and hashing methods for instances
of the class to be used in data structures like sets or as keys in
dictionaries.

Example
-------

The following example demonstrates how to create and use instances of
``SymbolFile``:

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.database.vector import JSONVectorDatabase

   vector_db = JSONVectorDatabase("vector_database.json")
   file_1 = SymbolFile("file_1.txt")
   file_2 = SymbolFile("file_2.txt")

   vector_db.add_file(file_1)
   vector_db.add_file(file_2)

   all_files = vector_db.get_all_files()

   for file in all_files:
       print(file.path)

This example adds two ``SymbolFile`` instances, one for each file, to a
``JSONVectorDatabase`` instance. It then retrieves a list of all files
and prints their paths.

Limitations
-----------

The primary limitation of ``SymbolFile`` is that it only stores the file
path where a symbol is located. It does not store any additional
information about the symbol or the file contents. This means that
``SymbolFile`` is only useful when working with other modules that can
provide more context, like ``SymbolGraph`` and ``JSONVectorDatabase``.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Is there any plan to extend the functionality of ``SymbolFile`` to
   store additional information about the file or its contents?
