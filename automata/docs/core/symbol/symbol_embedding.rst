SymbolEmbedding
===============

``SymbolEmbedding`` is an abstract base class that represents different
types of embeddings related to code symbols, such as
``SymbolCodeEmbedding`` and ``SymbolDocEmbedding``. These embeddings
help to represent source code or the accompanying documentation in a
format that can be used by machine learning models or other applications
dealing with code analysis and usage.

Overview
--------

The primary purpose of ``SymbolEmbedding`` and its derived classes is to
store and manage embeddings of code symbols obtained from different
sources. It contains methods to initialize the embeddings with a
``Symbol`` object, an ``embedding_source``, and a ``vector``
representing the actual embedding.

``SymbolEmbedding`` is the base class for more specialized embeddings
such as ``SymbolCodeEmbedding`` and ``SymbolDocEmbedding``.

-  ``automata.core.symbol.base.SymbolDocEmbedding``
-  ``automata.core.memory_store.symbol_code_embedding.SymbolCodeEmbeddingHandler``

Usage Example
-------------

Suppose you have a ``Symbol`` object and its corresponding source code,
as well as a precomputed embedding array.

.. code:: python

   import numpy as np
   from automata.core.symbol.base import Symbol, SymbolCodeEmbedding

   symbol = Symbol(
       scheme="scip-python",
       manager="python",
       package="example_package",
       version="1.0",
       signature="path/to/class#",
   )

   source_code = "class MyClass:\n    def __init__(self, x):\n        self.x = x"
   embedding_array = np.array([0.23, -0.67, 0.45, ...])

   symbol_embedding = SymbolCodeEmbedding(symbol, source_code, embedding_array)

Limitations
-----------

``SymbolEmbedding`` is an abstract base class, which means it cannot be
instantiated directly. Instead, it must be subclassed to create more
specialized embedding types.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Can additional metadata be included in the embeddings?
-  What types of embeddings can be added in the future, and how will
   they be managed within the class hierarchy?
