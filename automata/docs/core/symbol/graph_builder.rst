GraphBuilder
============

``GraphBuilder`` is a class that helps construct a symbol graph based on
a provided index. The class processes relationships among symbols such
as caller-callee relationships and symbol occurrences. It also supports
networkx graph operations and extraction.

Overview
--------

``GraphBuilder`` accepts an ``Index`` object and a
``build_caller_relationships`` flag as inputs. It then builds
relationships between the symbols within the index and constructs a
graph representation. The output graph can be used for navigation,
ranking, and manipulation.

-  ``automata.core.symbol.graph._OccurrenceManager``
-  ``automata.core.symbol.graph._CallerCalleeManager``
-  ``automata.core.symbol.symbol_types.Symbol``
-  ``automata.core.symbol.graph.SymbolGraph``

Example
-------

Here is an example demonstrating how to create a ``GraphBuilder`` and
build a graph from a given index.

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.symbol.graph import GraphBuilder
   from automata.core.symbol.scip_pb2 import Index

   # Assuming a valid index object
   index = Index()

   # Instantiate GraphBuilder with caller relationships set to True
   graph_builder = GraphBuilder(index, build_caller_relationships=True)

   # Build the graph
   graph = graph_builder.build_graph()

Limitations
-----------

``GraphBuilder`` relies heavily on the accuracy and integrity of the
provided index. If there are missing or corrupted elements within the
index, the resulting graph may be incomplete or incorrect. Additionally,
operations such as processing caller-callee relationships may be
computationally expensive and should be used sparingly.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Are there any alternatives to using networkx for constructing the
   graph?
-  Is it possible to improve the efficiency of graph operations such as
   processing caller-callee relationships?
