SymbolRank
==========

``SymbolRank`` is a class that computes the PageRank algorithm on
symbols in a graph. It takes a directed graph and an optional
configuration as input and returns a list of tuples containing a symbol
and its rank in the graph. ``SymbolRank`` can be used to find the
relative importance of symbols in a codebase.

Overview
--------

``SymbolRank`` calculates the importance of each symbol (class, method,
identifier, etc.) in a directed graph. It is used to find the most
relevant search results in the context of a query, code snippets, or
codebases. The class provides a method called ``get_ranks`` which
computes the SymbolRanks for nodes in the graph, considering optional
parameters like query-to-symbol similarity, initial weights, and
dangling nodes.

Example
-------

Here is an example of how to use ``SymbolRank`` to compute the relative
importance of symbols in a directed graph.

.. code:: python

   import networkx as nx
   from automata.core.symbol.search.rank import SymbolRank
   from automata.core.symbol.search.rank import SymbolRankConfig
   from automata.core.symbol.base import Symbol

   # create a directed graph
   G = nx.DiGraph()

   # add symbol nodes and edges
   G.add_edge(Symbol.from_string("local a"), Symbol.from_string("local b"))
   G.add_edge(Symbol.from_string("local b"), Symbol.from_string("local c"))
   G.add_edge(Symbol.from_string("local c"), Symbol.from_string("local a"))

   # create a SymbolRankConfig instance
   config = SymbolRankConfig()

   # create a SymbolRank instance
   rank = SymbolRank(G, config)

   # get the SymbolRank for each node in the graph
   ranks = rank.get_ranks()

   # print the SymbolRanks for each symbol
   for symbol, rank in ranks:
       print(f"{symbol}: {rank}")

Limitations
-----------

``SymbolRank`` assumes a specific graph structure and requires the input
graph to be a directed graph (``networkx.DiGraph``). Also,
``SymbolRank`` only works with ``Symbol`` objects as nodes in the graph,
which might not be suitable for all ranking use cases. It is limited by
the configuration options provided by ``SymbolRankConfig``, and any
additional custom configuration parameters will not be considered.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Can ``SymbolRank`` be modified to work with other types of graphs or
   objects as nodes rather than ``Symbol``?
-  How can we extend ``SymbolRankConfig`` to support custom
   configuration parameters?
