SymbolRank
==========

``SymbolRank`` is a class that computes the PageRank algorithm on
symbols in a graph. It provides methods to set up and initialize the
graph, as well as to calculate the SymbolRanks of each node in the
graph.

Overview
--------

``SymbolRank`` is mainly used to evaluate the importance or relevance of
symbols in a graph, based on their interconnections. It accepts a
directed graph and a configuration object as its inputs, and calculates
the ranks of nodes by iterating through the graph. The algorithm
converges when the error between rank values of consecutive iterations
is below a certain threshold.

Example
-------

The following is an example demonstrating how to use the ``SymbolRank``
class with a sample directed graph.

.. code:: python

   import networkx as nx
   from automata.core.symbol.search.rank import SymbolRank
   from automata.core.symbol.search.rank_config import SymbolRankConfig

   # Create a sample directed graph with some edges
   G = nx.DiGraph()
   G.add_edge(1, 2)
   G.add_edge(2, 3)
   G.add_edge(3, 1)

   # Initialize the SymbolRank class with the graph and a configuration object
   config = SymbolRankConfig()
   symbol_rank = SymbolRank(G, config)

   # Calculate the ranks of each node in the graph
   ranks = symbol_rank.get_ranks()
   print("Ranks: ", ranks)

   # Output: Ranks: [(1, 0.3333333333333333), (2, 0.3333333333333333), (3, 0.3333333333333333)]

Limitations
-----------

The primary limitation of ``SymbolRank`` is that it assumes the input
graph is directed and well-formed, containing symbols as nodes. It also
depends on the correct configuration, such as tolerance, alpha, and
maximum iterations, for the algorithm to converge successfully. In
addition, the algorithm may not converge if the graph is not well-formed
or contains dangling nodes that negatively impact the iteration process.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  How can we extend the ``SymbolRank`` class to work with different
   types of graphs or other ranking algorithms?
-  How can we improve the handling of dangling nodes to ensure
   convergence of the algorithm?
