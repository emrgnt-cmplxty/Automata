ITaskExecution
==============

``ITaskExecution`` is an interface specifying the behavior for task
execution in the ``automata.core.tasks`` module. It provides an abstract
method ``execute`` which defines how a task object should be executed.

Overview
--------

As an abstract base class (ABC), ``ITaskExecution`` does not include any
concrete implementations. Instead, it presents a method signature for
``execute`` to guide and enforce interface in inheriting classes. This
class ensures that all task execution behaviors adhere to a standard
protocol facilitating code reuse, modularity, and comprehensibility.

-  ``automata.tests.unit.test_task_executor.TestExecuteBehavior``
-  ``automata.core.tasks.executor.AutomataTaskExecutor``
-  ``automata.core.tasks.executor.IAutomataTaskExecution``
-  ``automata.core.tasks.base.Task``
-  ``automata.core.tasks.base.TaskStatus``

Example
-------

Inheriting classes must implement the ``execute`` method. Below is an
example of the ``TestExecuteBehavior`` class that provides a concrete
implementation of the ``execute`` method.

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.tasks.base import ITaskExecution, Task

   class TestExecuteBehavior(ITaskExecution):
       """
       Class for executing test tasks.
       """

       def execute(self, task: Task):
           # execution logic goes here
           task.result = "Test result"

In this example, the ``execute`` method modifies the ``result``
attribute of the ``task`` argument. Typical cases would differ depending
on the complexity and requirements of the task to be executed.

Limitation
----------

The primary limitation of ``ITaskExecution`` is that it only stipulates
how to handle task execution but does not provide any concrete
implementation. Thus, it relies on the classes that implement the
interface to provide the actual task execution behavior. This includes
the error handling and reporting strategy during the execution of tasks.

Follow-up Questions
-------------------

-  What kind of tasks are the ``ITaskExecution`` and its children
   classes meant to handle?
-  How can error handling be standardized across all classes that
   implement this interface? Is there a need for a standard strategy or
   should error handling be left to the concrete implementation?
