OpenAIAutomataAgentInstance
===========================

``OpenAIAutomataAgentInstance`` is a class designed to store the
instructions and configuration for an OpenAI agent. This class is
essential in that it enables the agent to be executed multiple times
without having to reinitialize it on every run.

Overview
--------

``OpenAIAutomataAgentInstance`` is an instance of an Automata OpenAI
agent which forms an integral part of the
``automata.core.agent.instances`` module. It includes a configuration
class ``Config`` that allows arbitrary types, effectively enabling
flexibility in terms of configuration options.

In its current implementation, the class features a ``run`` method that
executes instructions for the agent instance.

Example
-------

Below is an example of how to create an instance of
``OpenAIAutomataAgentInstance``:

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.agent.provider import OpenAIAutomataAgent

   automata_agent_instance = OpenAIAutomataAgent("Test instruction.",  automata_agent_config_builder) # Replace the string with the actual instructions and the config_builder with the built config
   result = automata_agent_instance.run()

Limitations
-----------

One key factor to note is that the proper functionality of
``OpenAIAutomataAgentInstance`` is hinged on the proper initialization
of the agent with the necessary configuration and instructions.

While the ``run`` method allows for the execution of instructions, it
lacks the functionality to modify these instructions without creating a
new instance. This could limit the efficiency of repetitive tasks that
require different instructions.

Follow-up Questions
-------------------

Given the closely linked nature of this implementation with various
other parts and providers, it might be worth delving into:

-  What are the specific instructions and their structure that
   ``OpenAIAutomataAgentInstance`` operates on?
-  How does this implementation interact with the OpenAI API and other
   automata providers?
-  Is it possible to modify the agent’s instructions or configuration
   once an instance has been initialized? If not, are there any
   workarounds to avoid having to create new instances each time there’s
   a change in instructions?
-  How does the arbitrary types allowed in the config impact the overall
   system’s robustness? How are type errors and exceptions handled?
