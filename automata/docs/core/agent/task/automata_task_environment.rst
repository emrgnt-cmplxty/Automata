AutomataTaskEnvironment
=======================

``AutomataTaskEnvironment`` is a concrete implementation of the
``TaskEnvironment`` abstract base class. It is responsible for managing
the environment in which an ``AutomataTask`` is executed. This includes
setting up the environment, committing the task to a remote GitHub
repository, and other necessary methods as required for the task
execution.

Overview
--------

``AutomataTaskEnvironment`` provides methods to setup and interact with
the task environment, which is based on a GitHub repository. It uses a
``GitHubClient`` instance to perform repository-related operations such
as cloning, creating branches, and handling pull requests. The task
environment is prepared with the necessary files and directories during
the setup process, and task status is updated accordingly throughout the
task lifecycle.

Related Symbols
---------------

-  ``automata.core.tasks.tasks.AutomataTask``
-  ``automata.tests.conftest.environment``
-  ``automata.core.tasks.base.TaskEnvironment``
-  ``automata.core.base.github_management.client.GitHubClient``

Example
-------

The following example demonstrates how to create an instance of
``AutomataTaskEnvironment`` using a ``GitHubClient`` instance.

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.base.github_management.client import GitHubClient
   from automata.core.tasks.environment import AutomataTaskEnvironment

   github_manager = GitHubClient(access_token="your_access_token", remote_name="your_remote_repo")
   task_environment = AutomataTaskEnvironment(github_manager)

Limitations
-----------

``AutomataTaskEnvironment`` relies on the successful interaction with
the given GitHub repository. Therefore, any changes or issues with the
repository or the GitHub Manager may directly impact the task
environment and its functionality. Moreover, the environmentâ€™s reset,
teardown, and validate methods are not yet implemented, leaving the
environment limited in its capabilities.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  How can we extend the functionality of ``AutomataTaskEnvironment``
   beyond interacting with a GitHub repository?
-  How should the reset, teardown, and validation methods be implemented
   to accommodate different use-cases?
-  How can we overcome the reliance on a specific repository structure,
   and make the task environment more flexible?
