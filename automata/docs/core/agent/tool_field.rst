ToolField
=========

``ToolField`` is an enumeration class that represents the fields of a
tool in automata.core.agent.agent_enums. The fields represent properties
of a tool such as its name, description, and the functions or coroutines
it uses.

Overview
--------

``ToolField`` provides a simple and manageable way to reference
important fields of a tool in the Automata ecosystem. It is primarily
used for internal purposes within the core.agent package and related
modules, facilitating ordered, readable, and easily iterable tool
properties.

Related Symbols
---------------

-  ``automata.core.base.tool.Tool``
-  ``automata.core.base.base_tool.BaseTool``
-  ``automata.core.agent.agent_enums.ResultField``
-  ``automata.tests.unit.test_base_tool.MockTool``

Example
-------

An example of using the ``ToolField`` enumeration to access the fields
of a tool.

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.agent.agent_enums import ToolField
   from automata.core.base.tool import Tool

   tool = Tool(name="ExampleTool", func=lambda x: "Example response", description="An example tool for demonstration purposes")

   name_field = ToolField.NAME
   tool_name = getattr(tool, name_field.value)
   print(tool_name)  # Output: ExampleTool

Limitations
-----------

``ToolField`` has limited direct application outside of the internal
usage in the core.agent package and related modules. It mainly serves to
provide a cleaner reference for accessing tool properties and does not
offer extended functionalities or customization options.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Are there additional properties or attributes expected in a tool that
   need to be accounted for in the ``ToolField`` enumeration?

**Note**: Mock objects mentioned in the context, such as ``MockTool``,
are used for test purposes and can be replaced with actual underlying
objects.
