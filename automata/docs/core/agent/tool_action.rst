ToolAction
==========

``ToolAction`` is a class representing a single action that uses a
specific tool in the Automata agent workflow. It is a part of the
Automataâ€™s action framework and is used to execute actions within an
``AutomataAgent`` through its various methods. ``ToolAction`` instances
can be created from lines in an AutomataActions configuration file.

Overview
--------

-  ``ToolAction`` helps in executing defined queries and methods using a
   third-party or custom-developed tool.
-  Instances of the class can be created using the ``from_lines`` class
   method.
-  The class can be used as a part of a pipeline or a sequence of
   actions in an ``AutomataAgent`` object.

Related Symbols
---------------

-  ``automata.core.tools.tool.Tool``
-  ``automata.core.agent.action.AutomataActionExtractor``
-  ``automata.core.agent.agent_enums.ActionIndicator``
-  ``core.agent.action.AutomataActionExtractor.extract_actions``

Example
-------

The following is an example demonstrating how to create an instance of
``ToolAction`` using lines from an AutomataActions configuration file.

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.agent.action import ToolAction

   example_lines = [
       "tool_query_0\n",
       "tool_name\n",
       "automata-indexer-retrieve-code\n",
   ]

   index = 0

   tool_action_instance = ToolAction.from_lines(example_lines, index)

Limitations
-----------

The primary limitation of the ``ToolAction`` class is that it requires
the proper formatting of the AutomataActions configuration file. The
class may not function correctly if there are any discrepancies in the
formatting or structure of the configuration file.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  How can we ensure proper formatting in the AutomataActions
   configuration file while generating tool actions?
