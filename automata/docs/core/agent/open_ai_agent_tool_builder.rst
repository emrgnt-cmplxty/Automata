OpenAIAgentToolkitBuilder
======================

Overview
--------

``OpenAIAgentToolkitBuilder`` is an abstract class for creating tools for
use with OpenAI providers. Tools are constructs designed to execute
tasks during a conversation, or within an iteration of an AI model.
``OpenAIAgentToolkitBuilder`` provides a framework for defining such tools
to enable interaction with OpenAI-based agents effectively.

This abstract class defines two core methods: ``build_for_open_ai`` and
``can_handle``. The ``build_for_open_ai`` method is an abstract method
and, therefore, must be implemented by any class that inherits from
``OpenAIAgentToolkitBuilder``. This method as designed to return a list of
``OpenAITool`` objects. The ``can_handle`` method is a class-level
method used to check if a given ``tool_manager`` matches the tool type
associated with a particular builder.

``OpenAIAgentToolkitBuilder`` is used in the context of the Automata
project, an undertaking that integrates OpenAI’s GPT-3 model with
additional tools and logic to create a more interactive, and rich AI
experience.

Related Symbols
---------------

Several classes and methods interact or have a tied relationship with
``OpenAIAgentToolkitBuilder``. Some of them include:

-  ``PythonAgentToolkit``: A concrete implementation of a builder
   class for generating tools to interact with PythonAgent.

-  ``ContextOracleOpenAIToolkitBuilder``,
   ``SymbolSearchOpenAIToolkitBuilder``, ``PyWriterOpenAIToolkitBuilder``,
   ``PyReaderOpenAIToolkit``: These are potential classes that may
   inherit from ``OpenAIAgentToolkitBuilder``, defining their custom
   toolsets and targets for interaction.

-  ``test_builder_creates_proper_instance``,
   ``test_builder_accepts_all_fields``: Test methods designed to assess
   the functionality and validity of the tool-building process in
   different contexts.

-  ``automata_agent_config_builder``: A fixture used as a way to
   standardize and isolate setup procedures for testing by generating an
   instance of ``AutomataOpenAIAgentConfigBuilder``.

Example
-------

Given the abstract nature of ``OpenAIAgentToolkitBuilder``, it doesn’t have
direct usage. However, a child class like ``PythonAgentToolkit``
provides an example of how such a builder class might be used:

.. code:: python

   class PythonAgentToolkit:
       def __init__(self, python_agent: PythonAgent):
           self.python_agent = python_agent

       def build(self) -> List:
           def python_agent_python_task():
               """A sample task that utilizes PythonAgent."""
               pass

           tools = [
               Tool(
                   "automata-task",
                   python_agent_python_task,
                   "Execute a Python task using the PythonAgent. Provide the task description in plain English.",
               )
           ]
           return tools

In this example, ``PythonAgentToolkit`` initializes with a specific
``PythonAgent``, and the ``build`` method constructs a specific ``Tool``
list.

Limitations
-----------

Being an abstract class, ``OpenAIAgentToolkitBuilder`` is not directly
usable and requires concrete classes to provide meaningful
implementations of ``build_for_open_ai``. This could lead to
inconsistency in implementations of its methods.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  What is the exact function of tools in the interaction with OpenAI
   agents?
-  How are the class capabilities extended or made use of within the
   larger Automata project?
-  What kinds of tools are typically built with this, and what are some
   concrete examples?

context and might not completely represent the functional scope of
``OpenAIAgentToolkitBuilder``. Some areas might require additional
clarification or input from the code developers for complete accuracy.
