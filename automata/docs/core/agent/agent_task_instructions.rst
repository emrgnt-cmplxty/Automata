AgentTaskInstructions
=====================

``AgentTaskInstructions`` is an exception class that is raised whenever
there is an error with the task instructions. It is primarily used to
ensure that the instructions provided to an ``AutomataTask`` are not
empty, and if they are empty, the relevant code raises this exception.

Related Symbols
---------------

-  ``automata.core.agent.task.task.AutomataTask``
-  ``automata.tests.unit.test_task_database.task``
-  ``automata.core.base.agent.Agent``

Usage Example
-------------

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.agent.task.task import AutomataTask
   from automata.core.agent.error import AgentTaskInstructions

   try:
       task = AutomataTask("task1", instructions="")
   except AgentTaskInstructions:
       print("Task instructions cannot be empty.")

Limitations
-----------

The primary limitation of ``AgentTaskInstructions`` is that it solely
checks if the instructions are empty or not. This means that it does not
validate the content of the instructions, such as checking if they are
well-formed, and may not catch any other issues related to the
instructions.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Are there any additional checks that should be performed on the task
   instructions before the task is executed?
-  Is there a specific format for the instructions that the code should
   validate?
