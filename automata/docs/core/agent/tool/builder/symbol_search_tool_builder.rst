SymbolSearchToolBuilder
=======================

``SymbolSearchToolBuilder`` is a class that helps building tools for
searching and processing symbols in a codebase using ``SymbolSearch``.
It provides functionalities such as building tools, processing queries
using built tools, and handling various types of search results. This
class is an essential part of Automataâ€™s core agent, responsible for
processing search queries regarding symbols in a codebase.

Overview
--------

``SymbolSearchToolBuilder`` offers a simple and convenient way to build
and process various tools related to symbol search using the provided
``SymbolSearch`` object. The main features of this class revolve around
(1) creating built tools using a list of search tools from
``SearchTool``, (2) processing queries using the built tools, and (3)
handling the results of these queries.

Example
-------

The following example demonstrates how to use
``SymbolSearchToolBuilder`` to search for symbols in a codebase using
various search tools.

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.agent.tool.builder.symbol_search import (
       SymbolSearchToolBuilder,
       SearchTool,
   )
   from automata.core.symbol.search.symbol_search import SymbolSearch

   # Assuming an instance of SymbolSearch
   symbol_search = SymbolSearch( ... )

   # Create an instance of SymbolSearchToolBuilder with the SymbolSearch object
   tool_builder = SymbolSearchToolBuilder(symbol_search=symbol_search)

   # Build the tools for symbol searching
   tools = tool_builder.build()

   # Process a query using a specific built tool
   query = "search_query"
   tool_type = SearchTool.SYMBOL_RANK_SEARCH
   result = tool_builder.process_query(tool_type, query)

Limitations
-----------

The primary limitation of ``SymbolSearchToolBuilder`` is that it relies
on the supported search tools defined by ``SearchTool``. Any additional
search tools will need to be added to the ``SearchTool`` enumeration.
Furthermore, the currently used processors for processing results are
minimal in the present implementation and might not cover all related
function cases.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Can we improve the handling of processors to make sure the
   implementation works well with different types of queries and tools?
-  Is it possible to dynamically add more search tools to the
   ``SearchTool`` enumeration without modifying its code?
