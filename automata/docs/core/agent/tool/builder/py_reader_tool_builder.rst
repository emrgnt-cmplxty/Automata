PyReaderToolkitBuilder
===================

``PyReaderToolkitBuilder`` is a class for interacting with the
``PythonIndexer`` API, which provides functionality to read the code
state of local Python files. The class allows for inspecting the local
code using a ``PyReader`` object, and it is capable of building the
tools associated with the Python code retriever, such as retrieving the
code, docstrings, or raw code of a specified Python package, module,
standalone function, class, or method.

Overview
--------

The ``PyReaderToolkitBuilder`` class allows for managing and interacting
with the code state in local Python files. By using a ``PyReader``
object, the class enables an interface to access code, docstrings, and
raw code of various Python structures. It is used in conjunction with
``AgentToolkitBuilder`` and other related tools.

Example
-------

The following example demonstrates how to create an instance of
``PyReaderToolkitBuilder`` and use it to build the list of available tools:

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.code_handling.py.reader import PyReader
   from automata.core.tools.builders.py_reader import PyReaderToolkitBuilder

   py_reader = PyReader()
   tool_builder = PyReaderToolkitBuilder(py_reader=py_reader)

   built_tools = tool_builder.build()

Limitations
-----------

``PyReaderToolkitBuilder`` is limited by its reliance on the
``PythonIndexer`` API for functionality. As a result, some functionality
might not be directly exposed by the class, and users would need to
access the underlying ``PyReader`` object for certain use cases.
Furthermore, the class assumes a specific directory structure for the
local Python files (modules, classes, functions, etc.) and may not work
correctly if the structure is not standard.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Are there any situations in which ``PyReaderToolkitBuilder`` doesnâ€™t
   work well, and how can these be addressed?
-  How could the class be expanded to include additional functionality
   for managing and interacting with local Python files?
