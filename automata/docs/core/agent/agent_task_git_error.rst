Example
-------

The following is an example demonstrating how to handle an
``AgentTaskGitError`` exception when interacting with a remote GitHub
repository using the ``AutomataTaskEnvironment``.

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.agent.error import AgentTaskGitError
   from automata.core.tasks.environment import AutomataTaskEnvironment
   from automata.core.base.github_management.client import GitHubClient

   access_token = "your_github_access_token"
   remote_name = "your_repo_remote_name"
   github_manager = GitHubClient(access_token, remote_name)
   environment = AutomataTaskEnvironment(github_manager)

   try:
       # Perform git operations using the AutomataTaskEnvironment
       # This could be creating a branch, checking out a branch, etc.
   except AgentTaskGitError as e:
       print(f"An error occurred while performing git operations: {str(e)}")

Discussion
----------

``AgentTaskGitError`` is raised in scenarios when there is an issue
related to git operations performed by an AI agent. This can occur when
the agent is interacting with a remote git repository where it needs to
perform tasks like cloning a repository, creating a branch, checking out
a branch, staging changes, committing and pushing changes, and creating
a pull request.

It is essential to handle this exception to notify the user about the
encountered git error and take necessary actions to troubleshoot it if
needed.

Limitations
-----------

The primary limitation of the ``AgentTaskGitError`` exception is that it
only provides information about the error related to git operations. It
does not provide solutions or suggestions to fix the problem. The user
or the AI agent should have a mechanism to handle these types of
exceptions and remediate the situation.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  How can we improve the exception handling process for
   ``AgentTaskGitError`` to provide more context about why the error
   occurred and possibly suggest some potential fixes?
