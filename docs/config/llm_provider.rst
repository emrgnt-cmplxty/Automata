To address the Follow-up Questions:

1. To decouple an LLM Provider when a new provider needs to be added,
   one potential method is to implement a factory pattern. This pattern
   allows the creation of objects without exposing the creation logic to
   the client and use a common interface. This gives the flexibility to
   add new providers while keeping the rest of the system unaware of the
   specific types of providers.

2. Using a factory pattern or a registration mechanism can allow for
   more flexibility in accepting different providers without modifying
   the enumeration class. Instead of defining the providers in the enum,
   a method can be created to register new providers. Each provider
   could be implemented with a unique identifier string, which can be
   used in place of the enum.

3. ``LLMProvider`` parameter is used in the configuration of an
   AutomataAgent to specify the provider for performing language model
   tasks. Below is a high-level example of how it could be used:

.. code:: python

   from automata.config.config_base import AgentConfig, LLMProvider

   config = AgentConfig(
       client_id='xyz',
       client_access_token='123',
       LLM_provider=LLMProvider.OPENAI
   )


   agent = AutomataAgent(config)

In the above example, the ``LLMProvider`` parameter in the
``AgentConfig`` tells the ``AutomataAgent`` that “when I have a task
that requires the use of the Language Model (LLM), use the provider
specified (OPENAI in this case)”. This could translate to different API
calls depending on the provider selected.
