1. As of now, there are no official announcements or documentation that
   suggests an update towards supporting additional ``AgentConfigName``
   types in the ``create_default_formatter`` method of the
   ``TemplateFormatter``. However, as per the demand or customization
   requirements of users or for broader applicability, there might be
   potential updates to this.

2. Any newly introduced instruction configurations would typically need
   to have their template definitions added to this class, so as to
   ensure that the new instructions are properly formatted. This could
   potentially affect existing functionality as it would need to be
   updated or adapted to accommodate the new instructions. However,
   without specific details about what these new instruction
   configurations might be, itâ€™s hard to ascertain the exact impact. The
   developers would have to ensure that any new additions maintain
   compatibility with the existing architecture and functionality.
