-  The conversion from ``kebab-case`` to ``snake_case`` is a convention
   used in Python to name variables and functions. ``kebab-case`` is
   commonly used for filenames or URLs, whereas ``snake_case`` is used
   for Python’s variable and function names. This practice fosters
   readability and helps to avoid syntax errors.

-  The use of enums for organizing configuration options makes the code
   more readable, maintainable and reliable as these enums group related
   values together. It also provides type safety since enums are
   essentially a fixed set of constants. While there may be other
   methods to organize these options (using dictionaries or lists),
   using enums could be preferable for the reasons mentioned above. The
   desired method may depend on the specific needs of the software and
   the team’s coding convention.

-  Currently, it does not seem like ``PathEnum`` is being used outside
   of the ``automata.config.base`` context, but there is nothing
   stopping it from being used elsewhere if the need arises. If other
   parts of the codebase have similar needs to handle path-related
   enums, it could be beneficial to utilize ``PathEnum``.

-  As for additional utility methods, it could be useful to have methods
   for handling path concatenation, checking path existence, creating
   directories, etc. However, these are general file handling tasks not
   specific to enums and might be better suited for other classes or
   utilities. The current ``to_path`` function seems to serve its
   purpose for ``PathEnum``\ ’s intended use.
