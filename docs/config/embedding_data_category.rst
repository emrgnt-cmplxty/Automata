1. The ``EmbeddingDataCategory`` class can be improved to be more
   flexible with both the location and type of the embedding data by
   utilizing dynamic configuration loading. For instance, there can be a
   configuration file that lists the embedding categories and their
   corresponding directories. The class would then read this
   configuration file, and set its constants accordingly.

2. Incorporating new types of embedding data categories can be achieved
   programmatically if a dynamic configuration approach is used as
   described above. Each time a new category is added to the
   configuration file, the class would automatically detect it and make
   it available for use in the rest of the system.

3. Yes, it is feasible to add a functionality for automatic detection of
   categories based on the folder structure within
   ``automata/configs/*``. This approach would involve iterating over
   the folders in the directory, and creating a category for each one.
   However, this method has its own challenges, as it requires that the
   naming and structure of the folders follow a strict convention.
   Additionally, it might be less efficient than the current approach if
   there are a large number of folders or nested directories to
   traverse. It could also potentially introduce unintended categories
   if not handled correctly.
