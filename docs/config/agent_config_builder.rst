AgentConfigBuilder
==================

The ``AgentConfigBuilder`` class in the ``automata.config.config_base``
module is an abstract base class used to build configuration objects
used by agents. In this context, agent refers to the Agent instances in
the automata system - this could include symbol search agents, python
code retrieval agents, and more.

Overview
--------

The ``AgentConfigBuilder`` helps in setting up agent configurations
through its various methods that allow adding or modifying properties
such as model, tools, stream, verbosity, max iterations, tokens and
temperature. The built configuration is used to tailor the functionality
of an agent. Setting different configurations can affect how the agent
performs and functions.

This class is intended to be subclassed, with the subclasses providing
specific implementation for particular types of agents. As such, some
methods (such as ``create_config``\ and ``with_model``) are abstract and
require a concrete implementation in the subclass.

Example
-------

As AgentConfigBuilder is an abstract base class, we cannot create an
instance of it directly. Instead, we will show an example of a
hypothetical subclass named ``AutomataAgentConfigBuilder``.

.. code:: python

   from automata.config.config_base import AgentConfigBuilder
   from typing import TypeVar, Optional
   from automata.singletons.tokenizer.single_tokenizer import SingleTokenizer

   T = TypeVar('T')

   class AutomataAgentConfigBuilder(AgentConfigBuilder[T]):

       def create_config(self, config_name: Optional[str]=None) -> T:
           
           # In this hypothetical example, the create_config method 
           # returns an instance of a hypothetical AutomataAgentConfig.
           return AutomataAgentConfig(config_name)

       def with_model(self, model: str) -> 'AutomataAgentConfigBuilder':
           
           # In this example, the 'model' attribute may determine 
           # the internal workings of the AutomataAgentConfig.
           self._config.model = model
           return self

   # Usage:
   builder = AutomataAgentConfigBuilder()
   config = (builder.with_model("model_v1")
       .with_stream(True)
       .with_max_iterations(100)
       .build())

This example demonstrates how a subclass of ``AgentConfigBuilder`` could
be implemented and used. The ``AutomataAgentConfigBuilder`` implements
the ``create_config`` and ``with_model`` methods specific to its needs.
When building the ``AutomataAgentConfig``, the ``with_model`` method is
used to specify the model and the ``with_stream``,
``with_max_iterations`` methods are used to specify other attributes.

Limitations
-----------

Since ``AgentConfigBuilder`` is an abstract base class, it cannot be
used on its own and requires subclasses to provide implementations for
the ``create_config`` and ``with_model`` methods. It is also tightly
coupled to the structure and functionality of Agent objects and other
related entities in the ``automata`` system.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  What specific Agent configurations are required in the different
   subclasses of AgentConfigBuilder?
-  Are there any restrictions in setting up the configurations - should
   properties be set in a certain sequence or are there any dependencies
   among properties?

This documentation was written based on the provided context in code
comments, method signatures, related tests and related symbols. Without
actual source code or sample responses, the specifics of method
implementations and returned results are hypothetical. Further
clarification may be necessary for a complete understanding of the class
and its use.
