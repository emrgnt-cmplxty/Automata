PyContextHandler
================

``PyContextHandler`` is an essential class in the ``automata`` framework
involved in the crucial task of handling the context linked to a symbol.
It helps derive valuable context from a given symbol and its relevant
constituents in the code base.

Overview
--------

The ``PyContextHandler`` class works with other entities, i.e., the
‘PyContextHandlerConfig’ configuration object, the
``PyContextRetriever`` entity, and performs a ``SymbolSearch`` within
the Python codebase. Beyond processing the primary symbol and its
related components, this handler also collects context concerning
supplementary symbols through rank matches, dependencies, and respective
associated tests, handling them accordingly.

-  ``automata.experimental.code_parsers.py.context_processing.context_retriever.PyContextRetriever``
-  ``automata.symbol.search.SymbolSearch``

Usage Example
-------------

Here’s an example of how to utilize the ``PyContextHandler`` with a mock
instance of a ‘Symbol’, showing how to construct a symbol’s context:

.. code:: python

   from automata.experimental.code_parsers.py.context_processing.context_handler import PyContextHandler
   from automata.experimental.code_parsers.py.context_processing.context_handler import PyContextHandlerConfig
   from automata.experimental.code_parsers.py.context_processing.context_retriever import PyContextRetriever
   from automata.symbol.search import SymbolSearch
   from automata.data_structures.symbol import Symbol

   symbol_search = SymbolSearch()
   context_retriever = PyContextRetriever()
   config = PyContextHandlerConfig()
   symbol = Symbol()

   # Instantiate PyContextHandler
   context_handler = PyContextHandler(config, context_retriever, symbol_search)

   # Construct symbol context
   symbol_context = context_handler.construct_symbol_context(symbol)

Note: In this example ‘Symbol’ is only a placeholder. You should replace
‘Symbol’ instances with an actual instance of the ‘Symbol’ class or a
mock ‘Symbol’ object if you are using this in a testing suite.

Limitations
-----------

-  One of the limitations of the ``PyContextHandler`` is that it does
   not currently sort symbols that a given symbol depends on by any
   specific criteria such as rank or similarity match.
-  Current implementation only includes symbols from tests if they have
   ‘automata.test’ in their path. Therefore, test coverage from other
   locations would be missing.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Could there be more flexibility in terms of how the
   ‘PyContextHandler’ selects the secondary symbols and dependencies?
-  How can we incorporate a methodology to rank or sort the dependent
   symbols?
-  What alternatives can be considered to make the test retrieval
   process more inclusive?
