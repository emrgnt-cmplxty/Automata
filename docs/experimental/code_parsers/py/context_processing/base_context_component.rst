BaseContextComponent
====================

``BaseContextComponent`` is an abstract base class that provides a
foundation for creating components that handle symbol context processing
in the Automata software.

Overview
--------

The ``BaseContextComponent`` class offers methods to process entries,
manage indentation levels, and generate data specific to the inheriting
subclasses. This class uses configurations such as ``spacer`` and
``indent_level`` for manipulating and formatting the context. Inheriting
classes, however, need to provide the implementation of the ``generate``
method, as it’s abstract in the base class.

Usage Example
-------------

Considering ``BaseContextComponent`` is an abstract base class, direct
instantiation is not possible. However, you can extend this class to
create a new component for manipulating symbol context. Here is an
example of a subclass:

.. code:: python

   from typing import Any
   from ast import AST

   from automata.experimental.code_parsers.py.context_processing.context_retriever import BaseContextComponent


   class MyContextComponent(BaseContextComponent):

       def generate(self, symbol: 'Symbol', ast_object: AST, **kwargs: Any) -> str:
           # Provide an implementation for the abstract generate method
           return f"Symbol: {symbol}, AST Object: {ast_object}"
           
   # Instantiate and use the subclass

   component = MyContextComponent(spacer='--', indent_level=2)
   processed_message = component.process_entry("Hello\nWorld")
   print(processed_message)

   # Providing a Symbol and AST object to the generate method might need additional setup

Please replace ``'Symbol'`` and ``AST`` with proper values fitting your
use case.

Limitations
-----------

While ``BaseContextComponent`` provides a flexible structure for context
processing, it has its restrictions. The class is abstract; thus, direct
instantiation isn’t possible. A concrete subclass providing
implementation for the abstract ``generate`` method is required. Also,
only basic context operations are supported: handling strings and
indentations. For more specific operations, further methods need to be
implemented in subclasses.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  How are subclasses of ``BaseContextComponent`` utilized within the
   overall architecture of the Automata software and what’s their
   interaction with other software components?
-  Could there be a standard method for processing symbols and AST
   objects within the ``BaseContextComponent`` class instead of the
   abstract ``generate`` method?
