InterfaceContextComponent
=========================

Overview
--------

The ``InterfaceContextComponent`` is a class within the context
processing portion of the ``automata.experimental.code_parsers.py``
module. This class is fundamental in converting Python abstract syntax
trees (``AST``) to an interface that can be used to document the
functionality of code.

The ``InterfaceContextComponent`` takes symbols and AST objects and
processes them to generate comprehensive code interface information. One
of its main functionalities lies in its ``generate()`` function which
converts a symbol into an interface and selectively processes and skips
private methods or classes as indicated. Another essential method is
``_process_classes_and_methods``, which in turn, delves into the AST
objects, processing all classes and methods contained within.

Additionally, this class has implemented safeguards against potential
recursion errors, with adjustable settings for maximum recursion depth.
Private classes or methods can be included or excluded based on
requirements, and even the method of documenting such as the headers for
interfaces and classes can be customized.

Example Usage
-------------

Here is an example on how to use the InterfaceContextComponent to
generate an interface for a symbol and AST object:

.. code:: python

   from automata.experimental.code_parsers.py.context_processing.context_retriever import InterfaceContextComponent
   import ast

   # create InterfaceContextComponent object
   context_gen = InterfaceContextComponent()

   # supply a python file from which to extract the ast
   with open('test.py', "r") as source:
       tree = ast.parse(source.read())

   # Generate interface using the context_gen
   interface = context_gen.generate(None, tree)

   # The interface string now contains a documented overview of 'test.py'
   print(interface)

Note: The actual usage of this class might be more complex, given itâ€™s
generally combined with the use of ``Symbols`` and various intricacy
associated with the ``AST`` objects.

Limitations and Unknowns
------------------------

There is a maximum recursion depth (default of 2) beyond which the
``InterfaceContextComponent`` will not continue iterating into nested
classes or methods. This limitation can potentially restrict the
comprehensiveness of a large or deeply nested codebase. It is also
essential to note the necessity of handling exceptions for failure to
process individual methods during the interface generation.

Furthermore, the exact role and utility of this class might be more
informed while understanding its utilization in the bigger context of
the library it resides in.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  How does this class behave with extremely complex and nested ``AST``
   structures?
-  Could there be other ways of implementing the parsing of ``AST``
   objects which might reduce the need for recursion depth limits and
   the complexity of the code?
-  What are the potential use-cases for this class in practical software
   development or documentation workflows?
-  Can it handle all different Python objects (e.g., decorated methods,
   static methods, class methods, properties, etc.)? Or does it have any
   specific restrictions?
