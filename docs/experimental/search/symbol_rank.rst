SymbolRank
==========

``SymbolRank`` is a class that implements a semantic code analyzer for
software corpora. Using techniques from language models and graph
theory, it assigns a rank to symbols such as classes and methods based
on their semantic context and structural relationships within the
software. This class is an implementation of the PageRank algorithm that
works on symbols in a graph.

The primary method ``get_ordered_ranks`` executes an iterative
computation similar to Google’s PageRank, but considers both the
symbols’ similarity scores to the query and their connectivity within
the graph. The result is a ranking of code symbols that aids tasks like
code understanding, navigation, recommendation, and search.

Overview
--------

The ``SymbolRank`` class is initialized with a directed graph and a
configuration that’s been validated. It calculates the SymbolRanks of
each node in the graph and allows retrieval of the top N symbols
according to their ranks. It also has methods to prepare the graph for
the SymbolRank algorithm, prepare initial rank values, prepare the
similarity input dictionary, prepare the dangling node weights, and get
the dangling nodes in the graph.

Usage Example
-------------

.. code:: python

   # Note: This is an illustrative example.
   # nx, Symbol, SymbolRankConfig are placeholders and should be replaced with actual imports.
   import nx
   from your_module import Symbol, SymbolRankConfig, SymbolRank 

   # Assuming we have a directed graph 'graph' and a configuration 'config'
   graph = nx.DiGraph()
   config = SymbolRankConfig()

   symbol_rank = SymbolRank(graph, config)

   query_to_symbol_similarity = None 
   initial_weights = None
   dangling = None

   ordered_ranks = symbol_rank.get_ordered_ranks(query_to_symbol_similarity, initial_weights, dangling)

   # Get top 10 symbols
   top_symbols = symbol_rank.get_top_symbols(10)

Limitations
-----------

The ``SymbolRank`` algorithm assumes that every node in the graph is a
symbol to be understood analytically. Misinterpreted or improperly
parsed symbols can lead to inaccurate results. Moreover, it applies the
same relevance weight to all types of symbol relationships, potentially
oversimplifying complex dependency structures.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  How can we modify ``SymbolRank`` to distinguish between different
   types of symbol relationships?
-  How does ``SymbolRank`` handle cases where some symbols are more
   critical to the software’s functionality than others?
-  How robustly does ``SymbolRank`` recover in scenarios where there are
   parsing errors or misinterpreted symbols?
