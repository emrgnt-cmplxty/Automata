-  The ``CodeExecutionError`` exception does provide a generalized error
   statement, which could be helpful in quickly identifying where the
   problem lies. However, creating further subclasses can indeed provide
   more specific error messages, which can aid in debugging a particular
   issue. For instance, having a separate error for SyntaxError,
   TypeError, etc., under the ``CodeExecutionError`` could be useful.

-  Including automatic logging in the class could be very useful. Log
   records can provide a history of what operations the code has carried
   out and can help to identify patterns in the errors or specific
   conditions under which an error occurs. This would help in
   effectively troubleshooting and diagnosing the problem. However, the
   decision to include automatic logging can also depend on the
   projectâ€™s logging strategy and the exception handling conventions
   being followed.
