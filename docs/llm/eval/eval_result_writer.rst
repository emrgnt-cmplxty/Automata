-  ``EvalResultWriter`` can be potentially extended to support other
   evaluation result schemas and objects. However, this would require
   modification of the ``write_result`` method since it currently only
   accepts ``EvalResult`` objects. You would need to design separate
   ``write`` methods for each evaluation result schema, or design a
   common schema and ensure all evaluation results objects adhere to
   this common schema.
-  ``EvalResultWriter`` doesn’t handle database failures or data
   inconsistencies on its own. This is handled by the underlying SQLite
   database engine and Python’s sqlite3 module. It will raise exceptions
   if there are issues with the database connection or transactions. The
   ``EvalResultWriter`` should ideally be used with exception handling
   mechanisms to catch these exceptions and perform appropriate actions.
-  The mismatch between the written and retrieved data structure can be
   handled by knowing the structure of the data before the code attempts
   to utilize it. After retrieving the data, the developer should
   extract out the JSON object and accompanying ‘conversation_id’ from
   the tuple before processing further. Alternatively, the
   ``get_results`` function could be further developed to return data in
   a more consistent format with the ``write_result`` function.
