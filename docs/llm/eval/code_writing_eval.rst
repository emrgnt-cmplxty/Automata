-  Yes, it is possible to extend ``CodeWritingEval`` to evaluate code
   writing skills for languages other than Python. This would involve
   creating new methods or modifying existing ones to parse and evaluate
   code snippets consistent with the syntax and behavior of the
   different languages. A more scalable approach could involve creating
   a separate ``Eval`` subclass for each language in order to keep the
   codebase clear and organized, or designing a general abstract code
   writing eval that could work with different languages based on a
   passed parameter.

-  Handling complex coding tasks may require more sophisticated parse
   techniques or the incorporation of more advanced programming concepts
   into the ``CodeWritingAction`` and the evaluation process. For
   example, concepts like recursion, control flow, and data structures
   may not be captured well by the current system. In these cases, the
   system could be upgraded to simulate running the code and assess its
   performance.

-  The robustness of the ``CodeWritingEval`` class to inputs that
   deviate from the expected format largely depends on the
   implementation detail of methods like ``extract_action`` and
   ``_parse_code_snippet``. Robustness can be improved by incorporating
   error handling and default behaviors for unusual or unexpected
   formats. However, itâ€™s important to maintain a balance between
   flexibility for different formats and strict guidelines to ensure
   accurate assessment. In practice, it would be best to standardize the
   format of the content thread as much as possible.
