OpenAIChatCompletionResult
==========================

Overview
--------

``OpenAIChatCompletionResult`` is a class that represents a completion
result retrieved from the OpenAI API. It is utilized within the
``automata.llm.providers.openai_llm`` namespace and is designed to
handle and structure the results returned from chat-based tasks using
OpenAI models.

The class primarily encapsulates the role and content of the message
received from the completion, as well as any function call attached to
the message, if it’s present. It can then provide this information in a
structured format, facilitating easier access and manipulation. The key
methods include ``__str__``, providing a string representation of the
class, and ``get_function_call``, which extracts the function call from
the completion result if available.

Related Symbols
---------------

-  ``automata.llm.llm_completion_result.LLMCompletionResult``
-  ``automata.llm.function_call.FunctionCall``
-  Various methods in scripts such as
   ``run_update_tool_eval.get_processed_paths``,
   ``run_update_tool_eval.load_json_data``, and
   ``run_update_tool_eval.filter_entries`` that handle JSON data
   processing and path management.

Example
-------

The example assumes that you’ve already made a call to the OpenAI API
and received a response.

.. code:: python

   from automata.llm.providers.openai_llm import OpenAIChatCompletionResult

   # raw_data is the assumed response from the OpenAI API
   raw_data = {
       'choices': [
           {
               'message': {
                   'role': 'system',
                   'content': 'Hello, world!',
                   'function_call': None
               }
           }
       ]
   }

   # Create an instance of OpenAIChatCompletionResult
   completion_result = OpenAIChatCompletionResult(raw_data)

   # Get string representation
   print(str(completion_result))
   # Output: system:\ncontent=Hello, world!\nfunction_call=None

   # Get function call (if any available)
   function_call = completion_result.get_function_call()
   # Output: None

Limitations
-----------

One key limitation of this class is its dependence on the specific
structure of the OpenAI API’s response. If the API changes its response
format, the ``OpenAIChatCompletionResult`` class may break or return
misleading results.

Furthermore, as of now, the class doesn’t perform any sort of data or
type validation for the inputs provided during the object instantiation,
which potentially may lead to runtime exceptions or errors.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  How does the system handle situations where the OpenAI API response
   does not match the expected format?
-  Does the system incorporate any mechanism to validate the
   ``raw_data`` input in its current state? Can this functionality be
   added?
-  In the event of API changes, how would the transition be managed, and
   are there any adjustments required at the user level?
