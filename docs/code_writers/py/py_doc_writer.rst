PyDocWriter
===========

``PyDocWriter`` is a Python class built to facilitate automated
documentation writing for Python modules. It is capable of generating
RestructuredText (``.rst``) files for each module, creating an
``index.rst`` file for each directory that contains subdirectories or
``.rst`` files, and producing a summary of the whole module.

Overview
--------

The ``PyDocWriter`` class simplifies the process of generating
module-level summaries and documentation. Given a base path of a Python
project, the class scans through each directory and generates ``.rst``
files using the content read from each of these files. Summaries are
created not just for individual modules, but also for entire directories
based on the existing ``.rst`` files. The class also ensures that the
directory structure is updated appropriately during this process.

Some key features of this class include:

-  **Flexibility**: ``PyDocWriter`` can work with any Python project
   simply by supplying the projectâ€™s base path during the class
   instantiation.
-  **Efficiency**: The class scans and processes multiple directories
   and files in a project concurrently, resulting in faster
   documentation.
-  **Detailed documentation**: ``PyDocWriter`` generates not only
   individual ``.rst`` files for each module but also an ``index.rst``
   file that serves as a summary documentation for all items within a
   directory.

Related Symbols
---------------

-  ``Symbol``: Represents a detected Python code symbol in a Python
   module or script for which documentation is to be generated.
-  ``SymbolDocEmbedding``: A data structure representing an embedded
   documentation of a ``Symbol``.
-  ``DirectoryManager``: A utility class used by ``PyDocWriter`` for
   directory management.

Usage Example
-------------

The following example demonstrates how to use the ``PyDocWriter`` class:

.. code:: python

   from automata.code_writers.py.py_doc_writer import PyDocWriter

   docs_dir = '/path/to/docs'
   base_path = '/path/to/project'
   symbols = [] # This would ordinarily be a list of Symbol instances
   docs = {} # This would ordinarily be a mapping of Symbol instances to SymbolDocEmbedding instances

   writer = PyDocWriter(base_path)
   writer.write_documentation(docs, symbols, docs_dir)

Limitations
-----------

``PyDocWriter`` currently has a few limitations:

-  The efficiency of the class heavily relies on the filesystem I/O.
   Therefore, the speed of the documentation generation process may vary
   across different environments.
-  The ``generate_summary`` method is not implemented yet. This method
   is expected to generate a summary from the content provided.
-  The class assumes that all ``.rst`` files in a directory correspond
   to the same module. This assumption might not always hold.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  What is the expected behavior of the ``generate_summary`` method?
-  How could this tool be improved to handle different project
   structures where .rst files might not correspond to the same module?
-  Could there be performance improvements in the file reading process
   that would make the documentation generation more efficient?
