-  Yes, the ``PyCodeWriter`` class is a part of the code writers module
   in the open-source automata project. It helps in generating Python
   code as per the instructions given to it. You can learn more about it
   by checking out the project’s documentation or the codebase itself.
-  The specifics of the error message associated with the
   ``InvalidArguments`` exception depends largely on the developer’s
   implementation. In a well-crafted system, the error message should be
   descriptive enough to make clear the incorrect arguments and their
   expected type or format. It should ideally guide the developer
   towards the correct usage of the method. If the error messages aren’t
   clear or descriptive, it might be considered a potential area of
   improvement in the system.
