As an AI model, I canâ€™t directly interact with or predict the behavior
of specific software packages. However, in general terms:

-  ``PyCodeWriter.InvalidArguments`` would likely be raised in
   circumstances where a method in the ``PyCodeWriter`` module was
   called with arguments that do not match what the method is expecting.
   This could be because an argument of the wrong type was passed, a
   required argument was omitted, or an unknown argument was provided.

-  Generally, exceptions like ``InvalidArguments`` are most often used
   as debugging tools for developers. In a well-designed system, they
   should not occur during normal operation and hence do not need to be
   caught and handled by the end user (except possibly to display a
   generic error message). Instead, they indicate a programming error
   that should be resolved by the software developer.

However, the specifics of how ``PyCodeWriter.InvalidArguments`` is used
would depend on the details of the ``PyCodeWriter`` and
``automata.code_writers.py.code_writer`` packages. For definitive
information, you should refer to the documentation or source code of
these packages, or consulting with other developers familiar with these
packages.
