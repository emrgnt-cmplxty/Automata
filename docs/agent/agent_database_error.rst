-  Given that ``AgentDatabaseError`` will be raised in cases of various
   database-related issues, it would be beneficial to include specific
   error messages or codes. This would make it easier for users to
   determine the source of the problem and know how to fix it, rather
   than needing to manually inspect the code and database setup.
-  Whether ``AgentDatabaseError`` is being used in test coverage would
   depend on the specific practices of the developers or team using it.
   As a best practice, it is usually a good idea to include error
   handling and exception throwing in testing to ensure that your code
   can gracefully handle any runtime issues. If ``AgentDatabaseError``
   is used in testing, it should be documented in the test cases to make
   it clear to other developers and future users exactly when and why
   it’s being raised.
-  The documentation for ``AgentDatabaseError`` should also ideally
   include examples of situations where it could be raised, to provide a
   better understanding for users who aren’t intimately familiar with
   the database provider setup.
