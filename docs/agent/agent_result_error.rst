``AgentResultError`` is typically thrown when an agent in the Automata
project fails to deliver an expected outcome after performing its task.
This could be due to an internal error, a communication failure with
other interfaces, or reaching the maximum number of iterations without a
result.

How the system recovers from this error greatly depends on the context
and the system design. In general, raising an ``AgentResultError`` would
be followed by diagnostic logging that provides useful information for
troubleshooting. The system might also catch this exception and attempt
a retry cycle, switch to a different agent, or notify the user about the
incident if the error persists.

For a specific recovery process, developers should consider the
trade-off between system complexity and resilience. Itâ€™s crucial to
strike a balance to avoid overcomplicating the system or making it
excessively prone to errors.
