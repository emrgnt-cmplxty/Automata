``AgentStopIteration`` should be raised in the scenario when an agent is
iterating through its tasks and has completed all of them or has reached
the maximum limit of iterations. It’s not necessary that this exception
can only be raised within the ``run`` and ``next`` methods. It can also
be raised in any method of an agent where a sequence of operations are
being executed iteratively.

As for how ``AgentStopIteration`` is propagated in the face of
exceptions like network failures, it generally depends on how exceptions
are handled in your agent class. If an unhandled exception is
encountered during the agent’s execution, it would typically stop the
execution and propagate up the call stack. It’s not
``AgentStopIteration`` itself that deals with these exceptions; instead,
it is up to the agent’s exception handling mechanisms to catch such
issues accordingly, perform any necessary cleanup, and optionally
re-raise ``AgentStopIteration`` to indicate that the process has
stopped.

In conclusion, the correct usage and handling of ``AgentStopIteration``
generally depend on the internal design of the agent’s task execution
logic, the iterative process, and the error handling mechanisms present
in your agent class.
