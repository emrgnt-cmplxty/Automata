-  The ``OpenAIAutomataAgent`` uses internal mechanisms to handle errors
   or timeouts. If the OpenAI API reports an error or timeout, the agent
   captures this as an exception and handles it accordingly in the host
   system. The exact handling might depend on the nature of the error.
   For instance, the program may choose to retry the request, skip to
   the next iteration, or terminate the process based on the error.

-  Extending the ``OpenAIAutomataAgent`` could potentially involve
   augmenting it to handle multi-stage tasks, tasks with more complex
   branching logic, or incorporating additional functionality such as
   sending emails, interacting with databases, etc. This would entail
   extending the class and adding new methods or modifying the existing
   ``_run_iteration()`` method. However, such changes would need to
   consider the implications on token usage, runtime, and other resource
   constraints.

-  The tools in the context of ``OpenAIAutomataAgent`` refer to a set of
   helper structures or external resources that assist the agent in
   executing its instruction. For instance, these tools could include
   APIs, databases, file systems, or other assets that the agent uses to
   perform its tasks. They can extend the capabilities of the agent
   beyond simple message generation, allowing it to interact with
   external systems and execute more complex tasks.
