Being an enumeration class, ``AgentToolkitNames`` provides ease in using
toolkit identifiers for managing agent tools. While it simplifies the
process of tool selection in the current setup, it is inherently static
and **update to this enum class is required when new toolkits are
introduced or existing ones are removed**.

In such a scenario, a new enum value corresponding to the new toolkit
must be added to ``AgentToolkitNames``, and a new builder class for the
toolkit must be defined in ``automata/core/agent/builder/``.

If an enum in ``AgentToolkitNames`` doesnâ€™t find a matching builder,
this would result in a **KeyError** at runtime when trying to access the
builder from the ``AgentToolkitBuilder.TOOL_TYPE`` dictionary.

To avoid this, developers should ensure that all enum values within
``AgentToolkitNames`` have a corresponding builder class in the
``automata/core/agent/builder/`` directory. Implementation ideally needs
to include a check whenever new toolkits are added, to ensure that
associated enum and builder exist.

On the same note, they should handle removal of toolkits cautiously to
avoid runtime errors. Deletion of any toolkit should include removal of
associated enum in ``AgentToolkitNames`` and deletion of the
corresponding builder class.

These changes should ideally go hand-in-hand and should be a part of the
same commit in version control systems to avoid conflicts due to partial
updates.
