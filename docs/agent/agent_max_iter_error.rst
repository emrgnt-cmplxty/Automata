As an AI developed by OpenAI, I do not have direct access to the
``automata`` module, a third-party package. I cannot retrieve its
concrete implementation details, making it challenging to answer the
follow-up questions concretely. Furthermore, my training doesn’t include
specific knowledge of this package. Nonetheless, I can offer a general
perspective based on common programming principles and practices:

1. **Default iteration count**: With most libraries that include a
   maximum iteration count, a default value is often defined. The actual
   default value can vary according to the specific parameters of the
   agent.

2. **Modifying iteration count**: Depending on how the library is
   implemented, the maximum iteration count could potentially be
   modified during an agent’s lifecycle. However, typically, such
   settings are defined during initialization and might remain constant.

3. **Recovery from AgentMaxIterError**: Typically, when a maximum
   iteration count is exceeded, the task that the agent was trying to
   fulfill is considered unsuccessful. However, the way this case is
   handled can vary. In some cases, it might be designed to attempt the
   task again with adjusted parameters; in others, it could fail
   outright and require manual intervention.

To obtain the most accurate answers, consulting the specific
implementation details of the ``automata`` library or reaching out to
its developers would be recommended.
