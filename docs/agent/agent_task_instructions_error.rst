-  ``AgentTaskInstructionsError`` is a highly specialized exception
   class, meant to only handle issues related to task instructions. In
   general, different types of errors should be handled by different
   exception classes. This way, it makes isolating problems and
   debugging easier through detailed & specific error messages.

-  ``AgentTaskInstructionsError`` is primarily used within the
   ``AutomataTask`` class, but it can also be integrated in other
   related classes or components where instructions on tasks are
   processed and required to not be empty. So, when an ``AutomataTask``
   instance is being created, be it directly or indirectly from other
   higher-level classes, ``AgentTaskInstructionsError`` comes into play
   if the instruction parameter is not properly provided.

   Further, it can also be utilized in logging and monitoring systems to
   track the occurrences of this specific type of error, thus leading to
   insights and improvements in instruction delivery and handling
   mechanisms.
