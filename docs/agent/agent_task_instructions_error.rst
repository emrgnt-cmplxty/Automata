-  Depending on the complexity of the task instructions and the specific
   issues that may arise, it could be possible to include more specific
   Exception classes to signal particular instruction errors. This
   detail would depend on the implementation and design choices made in
   the ``automata`` package.

-  The way an agent handles the instructions will depend on the specific
   implementation of the ``Agent`` class. For example, an
   ``OpenAIAutomataAgent`` might process the instructions differently
   than another agent type. However, for specific details on how the
   instructions are handled, one would need to dig into the code and
   workflow of the specific agent.

-  Adding a validation phase for the instructions before they are passed
   to the agent would be a good design practice. However, the
   feasibility and effectiveness of this approach would again depend on
   the specific agent’s implementation and the complexity and structure
   of the instructions. One straightforward approach could be to check
   for the type and structure of the instructions, attributes, or
   parameters required for the task execution. More complex validation
   might involve parsing and understanding the instructions’ content to
   ensure they are logical and executable.
