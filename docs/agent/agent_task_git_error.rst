Using AgentTaskGitError
-----------------------

Due to the nature of this exception, its usage is not as straightforward
as other classes. It will be raised when an error is encountered while
performing Git operations on a task. Here’s an example of how such a
scenario might occur:

.. code:: python

   def test_commit_task(task, mocker, environment):
       # Setup
       os.makedirs(task.task_dir, exist_ok=True)
       task.status = TaskStatus.SUCCESS
       mocker.spy(environment.github_manager, "create_branch")
       # Execution
       try:
           environment.commit_task(
               task,
               commit_message="This is a commit message",
               pull_title="This is a test",
               pull_body="I am testing this...",
               pull_branch_name="test_branch__ZZ__",
           )
       except AgentTaskGitError as e:
           print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

In the scenario above, we are testing the ``commit_task`` method, and
``AgentTaskGitError`` may be raised if there’s an error with any of the
git operations like creating a branch, checking out a branch, staging
all changes, committing and pushing changes, or creating a pull request.

Limitations
-----------

``AgentTaskGitError``, being an exception class, has its purpose solely
to signal the occurrence of an event that disrupts normal operation. It
doesn’t perform any operation regarding solving the problem or avoiding
it instead it exists just to signal it. The limitation regarding error
handling rests on the underlying git operations and methods that lead to
this exception being thrown.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Can we specify the types of Git errors that could lead to
   ``AgentTaskGitError`` being raised?
-  Are there certain Git operations more likely to raise this error than
   others?
-  Are there specific ways to handle ``AgentTaskGitError`` effectively
   within tasks?
