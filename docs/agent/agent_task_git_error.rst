-  Including more attributes in the ``AgentTaskGitError`` exception
   certainly can provide more context about the type of error and aid in
   debugging. Attributes could include information such as the state of
   the repository at the time of the error, the command that was
   attempted, and any returned error codes or messages from Git.

-  There are many different types of errors that could occur related to
   Git. It could be helpful to create different classes of exceptions
   for different types of Git errors, such as ``AgentTaskGitNotFound``,
   ``AgentTaskGitConflict``, ``AgentTaskGitPermission``, etc. However,
   the utility of this depends largely on how specific the code
   interacting with Git is able to get about the errors it throws; if
   the Git interaction layer only throws generic errors, creating a
   detailed hierarchy of exceptions might not be very useful.
