-  The number of instances of ``AgentInstance`` that can be created is
   not directly restricted in the code, but there could be practical
   limitations depending on the underlying system resources. Each
   instance might consume memory and possibly other system resources.

-  Currently, the ``AgentConfigBuilder`` supports the configurations
   provided in the provided classes and methods. If there’s a need for
   custom configurations, that would require modifying the
   ``AgentConfigBuilder`` class to support additional parameters, or
   extending it with a new class that incorporates the custom
   configurations.

-  While the ``AgentConfigBuilder`` does not validate parameters, it is
   possible to validate the configuration parameters before they are
   passed to ``AgentInstance``. This could be done by adding validation
   checks to the ``build`` method of the ``AgentConfig`` object, or by
   writing a separate validation function that checks the parameters of
   a configuration before it’s used. The specific details of the
   validation will depend on the requirements of the particular agent
   and system.
