-  ``AgentGeneralError`` could potentially have subclasses for further
   granulation of errors. However, whether such subclasses exist or not
   depends on the specifics of the error handling design in the package.
   Subclasses could be helpful in distinguishing between different types
   of errors, providing more detailed information to the users and
   developers.

-  More specific errors can indeed be beneficial in certain cases. If
   the system has known points of potential failure, then having more
   specific exceptions allows for more precise error handling and easier
   debugging. However, the ``AgentGeneralError`` should still be present
   to catch all the unexpected errors that do not fit into any of the
   specific cases.

Thus, a balance between general and specific errors should be maintained
for a robust error handling system.
