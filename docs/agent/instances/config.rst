-  Arbitrary types in the ``OpenAIAutomataAgentInstance`` are used to
   allow the passing and handling of non-standard python objects or
   custom classes. This can be useful in certain scenarios where you
   might want to work with complex objects that aren’t just basic python
   data types.

-  Allowing arbitrary types can have security implications. If
   unchecked, it could possibly allow for an injection attack where
   malicious code is run because it wasn’t sanitized correctly. It also
   can have implications for system resources. If a type isn’t managed
   properly, it could use excessive system resources and cause the
   application to slow down or crash. Therefore, enabling
   ``arbitrary_types_allowed`` should be done with caution and with
   proper checks in place. However, in the context of building AI and
   machine learning models, this risk is generally managed by the
   scientists and engineers working on the models.
