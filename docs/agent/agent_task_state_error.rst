1. Is ``AgentTaskStateError`` used during development or does it also
   handle errors in a production environment?

2. What exactly constitutes a “correct state” for tasks operating within
   the system?

3. Can developers create their own task states, or are they predefined
   within the ``automata`` system?

4. What is the expected manner of handling an ``AgentTaskStateError``
   when one occurs?

5. Are there any known issues or inconsistencies with how
   ``AgentTaskStateError`` operates?

6. Is ``AgentTaskStateError`` used by any other components or modules
   outside of ``automata``?

7. Does ``AgentTaskStateError`` function differently or have different
   implications depending on the provider (such as OpenAI or GitHub), or
   does it behave consistently across different providers?
