OpenAIAutomataAgentToolkitRegistry
==================================

The ``OpenAIAutomataAgentToolkitRegistry`` is a Singleton [1]_ class
that is responsible for managing and providing access to all the
registered OpenAI agent toolkit builders. This allows different parts of
the system to retrieve the correct toolkit builder when needed, without
needing to have direct knowledge of the specifics of each builder.

Overview
--------

The ``OpenAIAutomataAgentToolkitRegistry`` class has three main
responsibilities: 1. It maintains a list of all registered toolkit
builders. This is done using the ``register_tool_manager`` static method
that accepts a class of type ``OpenAIAgentToolkitBuilder`` and adds it
to a list. 2. It provides a method, ``get_all_builders``, to retrieve
all the registered builders. 3. It provides an ``initialize`` method to
load all the registered builders when the system starts.

Related Symbols
---------------

-  ``automata.agent.providers.OpenAIAgentToolkitBuilder``: This is
   the base class for all toolkit builders. Each specific toolkit
   builder must subclass this and implement its methods.
-  ``automata.tools.builders.PyReaderOpenAIToolkitBuilder``: This
   is an example of a specific toolkit builder. It is responsible for
   building ``PyReader`` tools for the OpenAI agent.
-  ``automata.tools.builders.PyWriterOpenAIToolkitBuilder``: This
   is another example of a specific toolkit builder. It is responsible
   for building ``PyWriter`` tools for the OpenAI agent.

Usage Example
-------------

.. code:: python

   from automata.singletons.toolkit_registries import OpenAIAutomataAgentToolkitRegistry
   from automata.tools.builders.py_reader import PyReaderOpenAIToolkitBuilder

   # registering a builder
   OpenAIAutomataAgentToolkitRegistry.register_tool_manager(PyReaderOpenAIToolkitBuilder)

   # retrieving all builders
   builders = OpenAIAutomataAgentToolkitRegistry.get_all_builders()

   for builder in builders:
       print(builder)

Limitations
-----------

The ``OpenAIAutomataAgentToolkitRegistry`` class assumes that all
toolkit builders are subclasses of ``OpenAIAgentToolkitBuilder`` and
implement its interface. If a class does not implement this interface
correctly, ``OpenAIAutomataAgentToolkitRegistry`` may not work correctly
with that class.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  What if we need to support additional types of builders that do not
   subclass ``OpenAIAgentToolkitBuilder``?

Over time, we may need to support additional types of toolkits for new
agent models. Given this classâ€™s current design, we would need to create
a new toolkit builder base class for each new type, and then modify
``OpenAIAutomataAgentToolkitRegistry`` to support instances of that new
class.

   A singleton is a design pattern that restricts a class to a single
   instance. In other words, there can only ever be one instance of the
   singleton class in the application.
