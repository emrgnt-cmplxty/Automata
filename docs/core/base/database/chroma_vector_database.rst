-  As an abstract base class, ``ChromaVectorDatabase`` itself does not
   contain any specific implementations for handling large-scale data
   sets or high-throughput data operations–these capabilities are
   entirely dependent on its subclass implementations.
-  The ``ChromaVectorDatabase`` relies on entries of vectorized data for
   its function. These vectors are typically numerical arrays. However,
   the concrete class that subclasses ``ChromaVectorDatabase`` may
   define the data type or structure.
-  ``ChromaVectorDatabase`` itself doesn’t provide any default error
   handling or data validation–these functions have to be implemented in
   the concrete subclasses. It is essential to validate the data before
   its addition to the database to ensure that it’s of the right type
   and format.
-  A concrete implementation of ``ChromaVectorDatabase`` would include
   using a specific database technology (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite,
   etc.) and implementing how entries are added, updated, retrieved, and
   removed from the database. It would also implement how the database
   is connected and disconnected, as well as how it is saved.
-  Concerning the Chroma database, it’s crucial to refer to the
   licensing documentation provided by the respective software
   company/provider, as any usage restrictions or licensing requirements
   would typically be stated there. There is no open-source database
   specifically named “Chroma”, so far as known. It’s possible that the
   term “Chroma” in this context may refer to a specific aspect of a
   database implementation, rather than a stand-alone database
   technology. Please ensure to check the accurate details from the
   relevant source.
