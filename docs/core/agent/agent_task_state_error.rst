AgentTaskStateError
===================

Overview
--------

``AgentTaskStateError`` is an exception class in
``automata.agent.error`` module that is raised when the task is not
in the correct state for the operation. This class deals with erroneous
cases where, for instance, an action is being performed on a task but
its state is not correctly set for that particular action.

Related Symbols
---------------

-  ``automata.tasks.base.TaskStatus``: Refers to various statuses a
   task can have, like ``CREATED``, ``RETRYING``, ``FAILED``,
   ``SUCCESS``, etc.
-  ``automata.tests.unit.test_task.test_task_inital_state``: A unit test
   that asserts if the initial status of the task is ``CREATED``.
-  ``automata.tests.unit.test_task.test_status_setter``: A unit test to
   check if the task status can be set to ``RETRYING``.
-  ``automata.agent.error.AgentTaskGitError``: An exception raised
   when the task encounters a git related error.
-  ``automata.agent.error.AgentTaskGeneralError``: An exception
   raised when a general error occurs during task execution.
-  ``automata.agent.error.AgentTaskInstructions``: An exception
   raised when there is an error with the task instructions.

Example
-------

The following is a simplified example demonstrating how
``AgentTaskStateError`` could be used:

.. code:: python

   from automata.agent.error import AgentTaskStateError
   from automata.tasks.base import TaskStatus, AutomataTask

   # Creating a Mock Task
   task = AutomataTask()

   # Simulating a condition where task is being executed without setting its status to 'EXECUTING'
   try:
       if task.status != TaskStatus.EXECUTING:
           raise AgentTaskStateError('Task status is not set to EXECUTING.')
   except AgentTaskStateError as e:
       print(str(e))

In the above example, an ``AgentTaskStateError`` is raised if an attempt
is made to execute a task, ``task``, without changing its status to
``EXECUTING``.

Note: Mocks are used in the above example for demonstration. In actual
usage, replace the ``AutomataTask()`` with the actual Operation to be
performed.

Limitations
-----------

The ``AgentTaskStateError`` class on its own doesn’t have limitations as
it is simply a description of a specific type of error that could occur.
The limitations would rather be on the workflow scale where
mismanagement or lack of proper checks on the task’s state could lead to
such errors.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  How does the execution pipeline ensure that the tasks go through the
   proper state changes?
-  Could there be any adverse effects if the state of a task is not
   managed properly?
