SymbolEmbeddingHandler
======================

``SymbolEmbeddingHandler`` is an abstract class in Automata’s codebase
that deals with handling the symbol embeddings. Symbols in this context
could refer to various elements of Python code like a class, a method or
a local variable. Embedding, in machine learning, refers to the
conversion of these symbols into a form that can be processed by machine
learning algorithms.

The ``SymbolEmbeddingHandler`` class primarily consists of abstract
methods that need to be implemented by the specific child classes. This
class lays out the signature of the key methods that any symbol
embedding handler should implement.

Overview
--------

The core methods in this class include an abstract constructor for
initial settings of the embedding database and embedding builder, a
method to filter symbols based on given sets, and methods to get and
process symbols’ embeddings. The class also fetches embeddings in the
order they were added through ``get_ordered_embeddings()``.

It must be noted that ``get_embedding()`` and ``process_embedding()``
are abstract methods that are intended to be overridden by the child
classes, hence the actual functionality would depend on the specific
implementation in those classes.

Related Symbols
---------------

-  ``JSONSymbolEmbeddingVectorDatabase``: A database handler class for
   symbol embeddings with a JSON backend.
-  ``EmbeddingBuilder``: An abstract class meant to build embeddings. It
   must be implemented in child classes to give actual embeddings.
-  ``SymbolDocEmbeddingHandler``: A child class that handles the
   database of SymbolDoc embeddings.
-  ``SymbolCodeEmbeddingHandler``: Another child class that manages a
   database for ``Symbol`` source code embeddings.

Example
-------

While the ``SymbolEmbeddingHandler`` class cannot be instantiated
directly as it is an abstract class, the child classes such as
``SymbolDocEmbeddingHandler`` or ``SymbolCodeEmbeddingHandler`` can be
instantiated and used in a similar manner as shown below:

.. code:: python

   # Mock EmbeddingBuilder and JSONSymbolEmbeddingVectorDatabase
   mock_provider = Mock(EmbeddingBuilder)
   mock_db = MagicMock(JSONSymbolEmbeddingVectorDatabase)
     
   # Create an instance of SymbolCodeEmbeddingHandler 
   embedding_handler = SymbolCodeEmbeddingHandler(embedding_builder=mock_provider, embedding_db=mock_db)
    
   # Use the get_embedding method
   symbol_embedding = embedding_handler.get_embedding(Symbol("test"))

Please note in this above example, ``Mock`` and ``MagicMock`` are
placeholders and for an actual implementation, you would substitute
``EmbeddingBuilder`` and ``JSONSymbolEmbeddingVectorDatabase`` with
their actual implementations.

Limitations
-----------

-  As ``SymbolEmbeddingHandler`` is an abstract class, it doesn’t have
   direct functionality and can’t be instantiated. The child classes
   provide actual functionality.
-  The specific embeddings for a symbol and the operations for
   processing it completely depend on the actual implementation provided
   in child classes. Therefore, the quality and performance of these
   encodings would depend on the specific child classes and their
   implementation.

Follow-up Questions
-------------------

-  What specific child classes are implemented for
   ``SymbolEmbeddingHandler`` and how do they differ in their
   functionalities?
-  How are the embeddings stored and processed in the database in the
   current implementations?
