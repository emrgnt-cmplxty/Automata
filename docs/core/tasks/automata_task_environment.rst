AutomataTaskEnvironment
=======================

``AutomataTaskEnvironment`` is a concrete implementation of the Abstract
``TaskEnvironment`` specifically for automating task management in a
GitHub repository.

Overview
--------

``AutomataTaskEnvironment`` is built on a task management environment
that is integrated with the GitHub repository system making it ideal for
managing and supervising ``AutomataTask`` objects. It provides
functionalities such as committing tasks to a remote repository, setting
up the environment by cloning the needed repository, as well as several
methods that await implementation like resetting, validating and tearing
down the environment.

Example
-------

The following is an example of how to use ``AutomataTaskEnvironment`` to
commit ``AutomataTask``:

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.github_management.client import GitHubClient
   from automata.core.tasks.environment import AutomataTaskEnvironment
   from automata.core.tasks.tasks import AutomataTask

   github_manager = GitHubClient(access_token = "your_access_token_here", remote_name = "your_remote_name_here", primary_branch = "main")
   task_env = AutomataTaskEnvironment(github_manager)

   task = AutomataTask("task_name", instructions="list_of_instructions")

   commit_message = "task commit"
   pull_title = "pull request title"
   pull_body = "pull request body"
   pull_branch_name = "branch name"

   # commit the task.
   task_env.commit_task(task, commit_message, pull_title, pull_body, pull_branch_name)

   # If successful, the method returns the pull request URL.

Please note that this code assumes that you have API access to a GitHub
repository, and you can get an access token from GitHubâ€™s settings under
the developer settings -> Personal access tokens.

Limitations
-----------

The ``AutomataTaskEnvironment`` class currently has several methods
unimplemented like resetting, validating and tearing down the
environment which leads to reduced functionality. Additionally, it is
also dependant on the GitHub manager leading to potential problems with
other types of repositories.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Will the missing methods like ``reset``, ``validate``, ``teardown``
   be implemented in future versions of this class?
-  How can we accommodate other types of repositories apart from GitHub
   in this class?
-  Can we enhance the error handling mechanism to provide more specific
   feedback on failure?
