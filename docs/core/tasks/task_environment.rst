TaskEnvironment
===============

Overview
--------

The TaskEnvironment is an abstract base class which provides an
interface for defining a context in which tasks are executed. It has
four abstract methods - ``reset``, ``setup``, ``teardown`` and
``validate``. As an abstract base class, it must be subclassed and its
methods implemented.

Example
-------

The following is a class that extends from TaskEnvironment and
implements its abstract methods:

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.tasks.base import TaskEnvironment

   class MyEnvironment(TaskEnvironment):

       def reset(self):
           """Reset the environment to its initial state."""
           pass

       def setup(self, task):
           """Set up the environment."""
           pass

       def teardown(self):
           """Tear down the environment."""
           pass  

       def validate(self):
           """Validate the environment."""
           pass

After creating the subclass, you can use it to create an object and call
its methods:

.. code:: python

   env = MyEnvironment()
   env.setup(task)
   # Do some operations...
   env.teardown()

Note: In the real implementation, you would likely put some real logic
into the methods ``reset``, ``setup``, ``teardown``, and ``validate``.

Limitations
-----------

The TaskEnvironment class is only useful as a superclass for other
classes. It does not offer any functionality on its own because it only
defines an interface without any concrete implementation. The
limitations of a TaskEnvironment will therefore depend on the specific
subclass that implements its methods.

Follow-up Questions
-------------------

-  Are there any expectations or requirements for the implementations of
   the ``setup`` and ``teardown`` methods?
-  Are there any specific conditions which would make the ``validate``
   method return False?
-  There seems to be test setup data included in the context, though
   itâ€™s not clear how or if it should be included in the final
   documentation.
