-  DirectoryManager doesn’t appear to handle threadsafety by itself. For
   multi-threaded scenarios where the same directory could potentially
   be accessed by different threads, synchronization mechanisms might
   need to be employed outside of DirectoryManager to prevent issues
   like race conditions.

-  As for the limitations on the size of the directory or depth of the
   subdirectories, the main constraints would likely come from the file
   system and the resources of the machine it’s running on. The Python
   code itself doesn’t seem to place any explicit limits. Large
   directories or deep nesting could potentially slow down operations,
   and extremely large amounts might cause problems like stack
   overflows. These situations could be mitigated by using methods like
   iterative deepening if they become an issue.
