-  Relationship between ``LineItem`` and line content’s Container: The
   ``LineItem`` is not directly linked with its originating container
   such as a Python file. As mentioned, it purely represents the content
   of the line along with its start and end line numbers. Any context as
   to which file or container that line content belongs, must be
   provided separately.

-  Utilization of ``LineItem`` in larger automata system: In the larger
   automata system, ``LineItem`` would typically be used as part of the
   representation of a code structure. For instance, when a certain
   coding structure such as a file, class, or method is parsed for its
   structure, each individual line or block of lines could be
   represented as ``LineItem`` objects. They give a granular view of the
   structural components of the code.

-  Interaction of multiple connectors or dependencies with ``LineItem``:
   There shouldn’t typically be situations where concurrency would
   become an issue with ``LineItem``. It is a relatively simple class
   that encapsulates a piece of information (line content) and some
   metadata (start and end line numbers). It doesn’t hold or manage any
   ‘state’ that could be modified concurrently. It’s essentially an
   immutable data structure: once created, a ``LineItem`` doesn’t
   change. Concurrency management would only become an issue if
   ``LineItem`` objects were being modified after creation, which isn’t
   the normal use-case.
