-  For the first question, as ``DotPathMap`` is based on the filesystem,
   it may not handle file or directory renaming or movements
   automatically. Once a module is renamed or moved to a different
   location, the mapper will lose track of it. If you are modifying the
   codebase, you would likely need to re-instantiate the ``DotPathMap``
   to rebuild the map with the updated module structure.

-  As for the second question, based on the provided information, it
   isn’t clear if ``DotPathMap`` directly supports live updates to
   namespace changes in the filesystem. Given that it’s reliant on the
   filesystem’s structure, it may not automatically track dynamic
   changes including module additions, deletions or modifications. Any
   such changes would likely require a re-instantiation to update the
   map.

-  For the third question, a possible solution could be having a
   separate ``DotPathMap`` instance for each application that references
   the global module. However, it’s not stated explicitly how global or
   installation-wide modules are handled. This would likely depend on
   where these modules reside in the filesystem and how they’re
   referenced within individual applications. Changes to these global
   modules would need careful coordination to ensure all referencing
   applications update their instances of ``DotPathMap`` to reflect
   accurate paths.
