1. Attributes of the ``BoundingBox`` class:

   -  The ``BoundingBox`` class primarily contains four numerical
      attributes indicating the ‘top’, ‘bottom’, ‘left’, and ‘right’
      boundaries of the box. These attributes indicate the maximum and
      minimum x and y coordinates covered by a particular symbol in the
      Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), thus defining its size and position in
      a 2D plane.

2. Interaction with ``LineItem`` and ``SymbolGraphNavigator`` classes:

   -  The ``LineItem`` class: The ``BoundingBox`` of a ``LineItem`` (a
      line of code represented in the AST) would represent the range of
      the line inside the file. This range can then be used to extract
      the specific line from the source code.
   -  The ``SymbolGraphNavigator`` class: ``SymbolGraphNavigator`` is
      used to navigate through the symbol graph produced from the AST.
      The ``BoundingBox`` property for each node in the graph helps
      locate each symbol’s position spatially. This allows for better
      navigation and interaction with the graph.

3. Executable usage of ``BoundingBox`` class:

   -  Currently, the ``BoundingBox`` class is intended for internal use
      within AST analysis and parsing, and is not meant to be used
      directly or manipulated by developers. It embodies a low-level
      functionality specific to AST parsing tasks, so usage examples may
      not be readily intelligible without a larger context of the AST
      parsing or code analysis operation.
