The ``ContextComponentCallable`` protocol is mainly used to ensure that
specific classes implement a ``__call__`` method, conforming to the
requirements of the protocol which dictates that they receive a Symbol,
an Abstract Syntax Tree object (AST), and any number of keyword
arguments, returning a string. Generally, it is instrumental in
maintaining the flow with classes that interact with the context of
Python codebases in the module
``automata.code_parsers.py.context_retriever``.

You may come across the use of ``ContextComponentCallable`` where
context components are needed to be handled during python code parsing
for symbol and its context retrieval.

In terms of performance impact, the use of the protocol should be
negligible. It is simply used to ensure that certain methods and classes
adhere to an agreed structure during development. It essentially allows
developers to write code that is more maintainable, easier to understand
and debug without any significant influence on the execution performance
of the program.

However, when misused or not understood correctly, it may lead to the
returning of incorrect data types which may result in runtime errors.
But, properly used, it ensures that developers adhere to a specific
implementation structure, improving code consistency and readability.
