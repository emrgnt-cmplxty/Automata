-  In terms of handling errors or exceptions when incorrect symbols are
   passed, there doesn’t seem to be any explicit handling of this in the
   ``PyContextHandler`` class itself. It would likely depend on the
   error handling mechanisms of the ``PyContextRetriever`` and
   ``SymbolSearch`` classes, which are directly handling the retrieval
   and processing of symbol data. If incorrect symbols are passed, these
   subsystems would need to raise appropriate errors.

-  Regarding the format of the ``construct_symbol_context`` output, the
   documentation does not specify a particular format. However, it is
   likely that the output would be structured to be compatible with the
   rest of the system that deals with symbol context (for instance,
   whatever components are reliant on the context handler’s output).

-  ``primary_active_components`` and ``tertiary_active_components`` are
   dictionaries that appear to hold different categories related to a
   symbol’s context. These may be populated based on the specifics of a
   codebase – possible components could include classes, variables,
   dependencies, and others. The specifics of how to populate these
   dictionaries could be project-dependent and is not clearly indicated
   in the provided documentation.

Without more specific information or a broader view of the project, it’s
difficult to provide more concrete answers to these questions. It might
be advisable to review the documentation or code of
``PyContextHandler``, ``PyContextRetriever``, ``SymbolSearch``, and any
other related classes for a more detailed understanding.
