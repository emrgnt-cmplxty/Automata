-  Aside from ``HEADLINE``, ``SOURCE_CODE``, and ``INTERFACE``, there
   aren’t currently any other context types defined in
   ``ContextComponent``. However, this enumeration can be expanded to
   include additional context types if needed.

-  In the base and Python context retrievers, the context components
   play a major role. Let’s break it down:

   -  ``HEADLINE``: This component is intended to provide a high-level
      understanding of a code block. It often includes elements such as
      class name, function name, inheritance hierarchy, etc.

   -  ``SOURCE_CODE``: Refers to the actual code within a module,
      function, class, etc. This code is often examined for comments,
      function calls, and other pieces that can provide context.

   -  ``INTERFACE``: This component typically incorporates aspects of a
      code block that interact with external entities. Function
      parameters, return types, class variables, etc., may all be parts
      of this component.

   The different retrievers will collect these components as part of the
   context retrieval process, use them to provide a more complete
   picture of what a piece of code is doing, and help in understanding
   its behavior.
