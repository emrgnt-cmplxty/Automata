1. FileNotFondError exceptions during File object initialization could
   be handled in the constructor of the File class. Exceptions handling
   can be used to check if a file exists before trying to open it. If
   the file doesn’t exist, the function can either create it or alert
   the user that the file wasn’t found. The appropriate action will
   depend on the specific use-case requirements.

.. code:: python

   import os

   class File:
       def __init__(self, name, parent=None):
           if not os.path.isfile(name):
               raise FileNotFoundError(f"The file {name} does not exist.")
           self.name = name
           self.parent = parent 

2. To handle more advanced file and directory interactions, additional
   methods could be added to the File class. Some potential enhancements
   could include:

-  A method to read the file’s contents.
-  Methods to change or retrieve the file’s permissions.
-  A method to rename or move the file.
-  A method to delete the file.
-  Attribute to store the file’s size.
-  Attribute to store the file’s creation, modification, and access
   times.

Each of these functionalities would require using appropriate system
calls, like ``os`` or ``shutil`` modules in Python.

Note that if more advanced functionalities are needed, it might be more
appropriate to use or build upon existing libraries designed to interact
with the file system in a more comprehensive way, such as ``os``,
``shutil``, or ``pathlib`` in Python.

Remember also to always consider security implications when dealing with
file operations, and properly handle any potential exceptions.
