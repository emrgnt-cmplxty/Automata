-  ``TaskGeneralError`` is usually triggered under circumstances where
   an error doesnâ€™t fit into other specific categories of exceptions
   thrown during task execution. A few such scenarios could include
   general system failure, invalid parameters passed to a task, database
   errors during task performance, or unforeseen errors due to unique
   edge cases.

-  Error handling in the broader Automata system would usually rely on
   exception handling, logging, and possibly retry mechanisms for
   certain operation types. It would largely depend on the design and
   architectural decisions made within the Automata system. As for
   general errors represented by ``TaskGeneralError``, retries might not
   always be useful, since a repeat of the action might just produce the
   same error yet again. Instead, these may typically require immediate
   manual intervention or a structural fix, depending on what caused the
   error. However, this could vary and automated retries could be
   implemented if deemed appropriate.
