-  No, in general, once an Enum is defined, it canâ€™t be updated or
   modified. This is by design as Enums are meant to provide a fixed set
   of values. However, if different or additional statuses are needed, a
   new Enum class or subclasses can be created to accommodate these.

-  The transition between different statuses is managed by the task
   executor. If an error occurs during the execution of a task, it is
   caught and handled by the executor, and the status of the task is
   updated to ``TaskStatus.FAILED``. If the error is recoverable and the
   task has not reached its maximum number of retries, the status may be
   updated to ``TaskStatus.RETRYING`` and the task will be attempted
   again. The specific mechanisms of error handling can vary depending
   on the implementation of the task and the executor.
