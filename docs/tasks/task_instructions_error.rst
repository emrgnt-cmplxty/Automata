-  ``TaskInstructionsError`` might be raised in situations where the
   task instructions are missing crucial information, contain incorrect
   or unexpected data types, or are otherwise malformed in a way that
   precludes successful task execution. The specifics would depend on
   the requirements and expectations of the components that are
   processing the instructions.

-  If there is a standard format for task instructions, details about
   its requirements would be contingent on the design of the
   ``Automata`` ecosystem. ``TaskInstructionsError`` would likely be
   raised if the instructions violate this format. Since
   ``TaskInstructionsError`` is intended to catch issues with
   instructions, it is reasonable to assume it would be used to enforce
   conformity to a standard format.
