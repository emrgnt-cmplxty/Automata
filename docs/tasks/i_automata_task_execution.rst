1. If the ``_build_agent`` method of ``IAutomataTaskExecution`` is used
   with other configurations, it would depend on how the new
   configuration gets along with the other parts of the system. The
   ``_build_agent`` method uses a specific configuration to create an
   ``OpenAIAutomataAgent``, which is designed to work with that specific
   configuration. Using a different configuration may fail if itâ€™s
   incompatible with the ``OpenAIAutomataAgent`` or the task at hand.

2. Yes, the retry functionality could potentially be improved to adapt
   depending on the nature of the task or the kind of error detected.
   For example, some errors might be identified as temporary or
   network-related, which could be rectified by simply retrying after a
   brief delay. On the other hand, some errors might be due to an issue
   with the implementation of the task, and in these cases, retrying
   would just cause the same error again. In these scenarios, the system
   could be improved to recognize the type of error and make an informed
   decision about whether to retry or not. However, implementing such an
   adaptive retry mechanism would likely be complex and might require
   significant changes to the existing architecture.
