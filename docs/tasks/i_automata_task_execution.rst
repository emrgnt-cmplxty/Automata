IAutomataTaskExecution
======================

Overview
--------

``IAutomataTaskExecution`` is a class intended for executing general
tasks. It serves as the driving mechanism for task execution,
constructing a OpenAIAutomataAgent from a provided task and managing the
agent’s lifecycle. This includes starting the execution of the agent,
handling task failures and reattempting, and logging the status of the
task.

The ``execute(task: Task)`` method is used to execute an instance of the
``Task`` class. The method performs a set of operations in an orderly
manner. The task’s status is switched to ``RUNNING``, after which an
``OpenAIAutomataAgent`` is constructed for the task and executed. If the
execution finishes successfully, the task’s result is obtained, and its
status is updated to ``SUCCESS``. If an error occurs during execution,
the task’s error field is updated, its status is updated to ``FAILED``,
and its retry number is incremented.

The ``OpenAIAutomataAgent`` is created using the
``_build_agent(task: AutomataTask)`` method. This agent is generated
from the ``OpenAIAutomataAgentConfigBuilder`` using the task’s
arguments.

Example
-------

This example demonstrates how to create an instance of
``IAutomataTaskExecution`` and execute a task.

.. code:: python

   from automata.tasks.task_executor import IAutomataTaskExecution
   from automata.tasks import AutomataTask

   # create a task instance
   task = AutomataTask(
       session_id="testing_session", 
       kwargs={
           "instructions": "Translate the text from English to French", 
           "text": "Hello world"
       }
   )

   # Create an instance of IAutomataTaskExecution and execute the task
   task_executor = IAutomataTaskExecution()
   agent = task_executor.execute(task)

Limitations
-----------

One of the known limitations of the ``IAutomataTaskExecution`` class is
that it continues to attempt execution after errors. This could lead to
undesired consequences in case of a persistent problem causing the task
to fail repeatedly. Additionally, this class only accepts task instances
of ``AutomataTask`` type. The execution fails if the task instance does
not belong to this type.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  How is the number of retries managed? Is there a set limit to the
   number of times a failed task is reattempted?
-  Is there a mechanism for intercepting and mitigating persistent
   errors during task execution?
