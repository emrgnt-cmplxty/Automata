-  No, ``SymbolDescriptor.PyKind`` Enum does not include all possible
   classifications of Python entities. For example, it does not include
   categories such as Python decorators, generators, coroutines, etc.
   However, they include the most commonly used Python entities. For
   specific use cases, you might need to extend the Enum.

-  The ‘meta’ category in ``SymbolDescriptor.PyKind`` is used for Python
   entities that are related to metaprogramming. Metaprogramming refers
   to the potential ability of a program to have knowledge of or
   manipulate itself. In Python, it is achieved via metaclasses,
   decorators, etc.

-  The ‘type_parameter’ category in ``SymbolDescriptor.PyKind`` is
   related to Python’s type hinting system introduced in Python 3.5.
   Type hinting is a formal solution to statically indicate the type of
   a value within your Python code. This is used with the typing module,
   which provides objects that represent complex types like Union,
   Optional, etc. The ‘type_parameter’ represents type variables in such
   complex types. For example, in ``List[T]``, ``T`` is a type
   parameter.
