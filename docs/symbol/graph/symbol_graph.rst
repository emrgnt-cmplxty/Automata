1. Extending ``SymbolGraph`` to support more types of relationships like
   inheritance and usage is feasible and indeed very useful. This would
   involve adding additional logic to detect and represent these
   relationships in the underlying data structures. The complexity would
   depend on various factors such as the specifics of the file format
   and programming language(s) being analyzed. It’s important to note
   however, that supporting such relationships may increase memory usage
   and computation time, and therefore it is important to optimize the
   representations and processing algorithms.

2. Currently, ``automata`` doesn’t support the generation of the index
   file. This is a valid suggestion and could potentially add
   significantly to the usefulness of ``SymbolGraph``. Including this
   functionality directly in ``automata`` could help users create and
   manipulate ``SymbolGraph`` objects without needing to interact with
   external tools. This could be implemented as a new feature request if
   it aligns with the library’s overall goals and design philosophy.

3. Performance is a key concern when working with large codebases. As
   the number of symbols and relationships increases, so does the
   complexity and memory usage of the graph. It’s hard to provide
   specific numbers without implementation details and benchmarks, but
   in principle, handling millions of symbols and relationships would
   require efficient graph algorithms and data structures, and might
   necessitate the use of techniques such as graph pruning or
   partitioning.

   Furthermore, performance doesn’t depend only on the number of symbols
   and relationships. The kinds of operations performed on the graph
   (e.g. query speed, update speed), the types of relationships
   considered, and the density of the graph also play a role.

   Overall, this reinforces the need for continued care in the design
   and implementation of ``SymbolGraph`` to strike the right balance
   between expressive power and scalability. Design decisions and
   optimizations would need to be carefully considered to cater to the
   varying needs of different users.
