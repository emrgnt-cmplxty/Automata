RelationshipProcessor
=====================

``RelationshipProcessor`` is a class in the
``automata.symbol.graph.symbol_relationships`` module that helps in
adding edges to a ``MultiDiGraph`` in the context of ``Symbol`` nodes’
relationships.

Overview
--------

``RelationshipProcessor`` implements a processor mechanism for handling
relationship among ``Symbol`` nodes. The primary purpose of this class
is to process relationships in the form of inheritance among symbols and
records these relationships within a ``MultiDiGraph``. ``Symbol``\ s are
considered related if they share an inheritance relationship.

In this context, when referring to relationships, it can be seen as the
“inheritance” between classes or “implementation” between an interface
and a class.

Related Symbols
---------------

-  ``nx.MultiDiGraph``: Multi directed graph from ``networkx`` library
   used as data structure.
-  ``parse_symbol``: A function (Not visible from the context) to parse
   symbol information.
-  ``MessageToDict``: A function (Not visible from the context) to
   convert a message to dictionary.

Usage Example
-------------

The following is an example demonstrating how to use
``RelationshipProcessor``. As the ``parse_symbol`` and ``MessageToDict``
functions are not visible in the provided context, we’ll use mock
versions of these functions.

.. code:: python

   import networkx as nx
   from automata.symbol.graph.symbol_relationships import RelationshipProcessor

   # Assuming parse_symbol & MessageToDict are importable
   from automata.utils import parse_symbol, MessageToDict

   # Note: `symbol_information` structure not detailed in the context
   symbol_information = {...} 

   graph = nx.MultiDiGraph()
   processor = RelationshipProcessor(graph=graph, symbol_information=symbol_information)
   processor.process()

Please make sure to replace ``{...}`` with actual symbol information.

Limitations
-----------

The details regarding the format and structure of ``symbol_information``
provided to the ``RelationshipProcessor`` is not provided in the
context. This structure is pivotal to the functionality of
``RelationshipProcessor`` as it processes the relationships based on
this data.

Ensuring the proper functioning of the ``RelationshipProcessor``
requires precise understanding of the implementation of the
``parse_symbol`` and ``MessageToDict`` functions, which are not provided
in the current context.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  What is the expected format and structure of ``symbol_information``
   in ``RelationshipProcessor``?
-  Could we get more information - such as function definitions and
   imports - for ``parse_symbol`` and ``MessageToDict``?
