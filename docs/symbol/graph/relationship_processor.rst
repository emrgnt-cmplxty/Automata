-  ``relationship_labels.pop('symbol')`` removes the ‘symbol’ key from
   the dictionary ``relationship_labels``, returning the value
   associated with it. This is likely done because the ‘symbol’ key is
   not used in the graph.

-  ``symbol_information`` is expected to be a list of ``Symbol``
   Protobuf objects. These objects represent software entities such as
   classes or functions.

-  Some potential exceptions could be ``KeyError`` when trying to
   ``pop()`` a non-existent key from the dictionary. There could also be
   errors if the ``symbol_information`` list does not contain valid
   ``Symbol`` Protobuf objects or if there are inconsistencies in the
   structure of these objects.

-  The ``RelationshipProcessor`` class is mainly used in the context of
   mapping a codebase, particularly to analyze and visualize
   relationships between different code entities such as classes,
   methods or functions. This helps to understand the dependencies and
   interactions within the codebase. It forms part of a process that
   includes other components like searching Git repositories, parsing
   source code files, or generating symbol definitions from parsed code.
   Its result can be used for several purposes like code completion,
   code base navigation, and even code generation.
