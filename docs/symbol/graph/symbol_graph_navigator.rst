-  If the graph passed to ``SymbolGraphNavigator`` is not correctly
   structured or doesnâ€™t have all the necessary details, the various
   methods in the class like ``get_potential_symbol_callees``,
   ``get_potential_symbol_calless``, etc., might return incomplete or
   incorrect results. It would be best to perform a validation check on
   the graph before passing it to ``SymbolGraphNavigator``.

-  As for handling missing or incorrect labels on the graph edges, one
   approach could be to raise informative errors when such labels are
   not found. The error message could include details about what labels
   were expected and suggestions about how to fix the graph.
   Alternatively, the class could provide a method for adding or
   updating labels on the graph edges.

-  Whether or not functionality should be added to modify the graph in
   ``SymbolGraphNavigator`` depends on the use cases of this class.
   Currently, the class seems to be designed mainly for navigating the
   graph and querying relationships between the symbols. If there were
   use cases where the graph needed to be modified after the initial
   creation, then it would be worth considering the addition of graph
   modification functionality. However, if such needs arise, it might be
   more appropriate to handle them in a separate class, in order to keep
   the responsibilities of ``SymbolGraphNavigator`` clearly defined and
   its implementation more manageable. Another approach could be to have
   a separate ``SymbolGraphUpdater`` or ``SymbolGraphEditor`` class
   responsible for adding, deleting or modifying nodes or edges in the
   graph.
