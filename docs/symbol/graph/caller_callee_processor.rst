-  To modify the ``CallerCalleeProcessor`` to include other types of
   symbols, it may be necessary to extend the ``Symbol`` class with
   custom behavior for each new type of symbol. This would require
   modifications to the parsing logic and the graph generation logic.
   You would also have to upgrade the ``process`` function to handle
   these new symbols, and possibly write new helper methods to handle
   their particular features.

-  Optimization of the ``CallerCalleeProcessor`` for larger projects
   could involve a number of strategies. Firstly, it could involve
   subsetting the graph and processing smaller pieces in parallel, i.e.,
   using a divide and conquer strategy. Secondly, data structures used
   in the implementation could be re-evaluated to ensure that theyâ€™re
   the most efficient for the task at hand. Thirdly, some level of
   caching could be introduced to prevent re-processing of symbols that
   have already been accounted for. Lastly, one might look into lazy
   evaluation techniques, where the caller-callee relationships are only
   computed as necessary for the specific task at hand.
