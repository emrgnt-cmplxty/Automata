-  Unfortunately, the type of document that ``CallerCalleeProcessor``
   works with isn’t specified in the provided information. However,
   given the context, it’s likely that this class works with codebase
   documents (such as Python files), containing ``Symbol`` objects
   representing different elements of code (classes, methods, etc.).

-  If a ``Symbol`` node refers to something other than a method or
   class, the behavior of ``CallerCalleeProcessor`` would depend on its
   implementation. However, it’s likely that it simply wouldn’t create
   an edge in such situations since the intention is to map
   relationships between classes and methods.

-  The question of whether ``CallerCalleeProcessor`` handles recursive
   calls isn’t directly addressed in the provided text. However, since
   it’s mapping the relationships between caller and callee and since
   recursive calls are a relationship between a method and itself,
   there’s a high chance that it would handle them appropriately.

-  In terms of error handling during symbol parsing and reference
   fetching, it is mentioned that these errors are logged, indicating
   that there’s some kind of error handling system in place. However,
   the specifics of this system aren’t detailed.

-  The question of whether there’s a way to optimize the ``process``
   method to make it less resource-intensive is a common concern with
   resource-heavy operations. While there’s no specific mention in the
   provided text, common methods to optimize such operations could
   include limiting the number of nodes processed at once, using more
   efficient data structures, caching results, and doing lazy loading
   when possible.

-  In the case of a large graph with many symbols, the performance of
   the ``process`` method would depend on many factors, including the
   implementation of the method and the resources available (CPU,
   memory, etc.). Techniques like partitioning the graph, parallel
   processing, and memory-optimized data structures can be used to help
   manage performance on large graphs.
