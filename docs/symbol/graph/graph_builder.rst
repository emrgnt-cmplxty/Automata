GraphBuilder
============

``GraphBuilder`` is a class that the main purpose is to build a network
graph (``SymbolGraph``) from a distinct ``Index``. It provides a concise
way to create and manage the graph for symbol information included in
the documents. It includes functionalities to load data, generate graph
notes, and edges based on relationships, references, and calls between
``Symbol`` nodes.

Overview
--------

The ``GraphBuilder`` class in the
``automata.symbol.graph.graph_builder`` module aims to create a symbol
information graph by iterating over the documents in a given index. It
has various methods that help manage and create graph nodes and edges.
It sets up nodes for each symbol found in the documents, and edges are
formed based on the reference, relationship, or call between two
``Symbol`` nodes. The data used in the graph may also be retrieved or
stored using pickle files for efficient loading and saving.

Example
-------

Given this class relies on a specific index structure, a direct simple
example cannot be provided. However, you should first create an
``Index`` that matches your needs and then use ``GraphBuilder`` to
create a ``SymbolGraph``. Here is a generic description using mock
objects:

.. code:: python

   from automata.symbol.graph.graph_builder import GraphBuilder
   from your_module import YourIndex

   # Suppose you have your own Index class
   index = YourIndex('index_file_path')

   # Instantiate GraphBuilder
   graph_builder = GraphBuilder(index=index, build_references=True, build_relationships=True, build_caller_relationships=False)

   # Now you can build your graph
   graph = graph_builder.build_graph(from_pickle=False, save_graph_pickle=False)

Keep in mind that this example assumes you have an ``Index`` object
``YourIndex`` to provide for ``GraphBuilder``. ``from_pickle`` indicates
if the graph should be loaded from a pickle file, and
``save_graph_pickle`` denotes if the generated graph should be stored as
a pickle file.

Limitations
-----------

``GraphBuilder`` assumes the index provided is in a specific structure,
which means it might not work correctly with arbitrary index data
structures. Also, the ``build_graph`` method could potentially raise a
ValueError if no index data is found or is inaccessible.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  What is the exact structure of the Index that GraphBuilder expects?
-  What should be the content of the index file for optimal results?
-  Could there be optimization in the graph building process especially
   for large data?
-  Can the support for additional relationships be added to enhance the
   graphâ€™s descriptiveness?
