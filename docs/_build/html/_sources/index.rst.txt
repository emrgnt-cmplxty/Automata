Automata: The Future is Self-Written
====================================

`Automata <https://github.com/emrgnt-cmplxty/Automata>`_ is an evolving, fully autonomous, self-programming Artificial Intelligence system. It utilizes Large Language Models like GPT-4 and a vector database to document, search, and write code, paving the path for the creation of AGI.

**Getting Started**

For those looking to embark on a journey with Automata, our quick-start guides are your first steps to understanding and implementing the project's core features:

- For setup instructions, refer to our :doc:`detailed setup guide <setup_guide>`
- Learn how to create :doc:`your own embeddings <embedding_guide>`
- Run  :doc:`your own agent <agent_guide>`

**Key Features**

Automata comes with several core features, designed to promote a rich and interactive AI development experience. Each feature has associated examples and API documentation to ease your understanding and usage.

These features include, in order of complexity:

- `Embeddings`_: Documentations on how to generate code embeddings for Automata Interpreter codebase.
  
- `Code and Documentation Generation`_: Guides on comprehensive code and documentation generation forming the backbone of Automata's self-programming ability.

- `Indexing`: In-depth tutorials on creating and using SCIP indices for the Automata Search.

- `Execution`: Detailed information about executing advanced coding tasks using downstream tooling.

- `Automata Agent`: Complete guide on how to run an Automata agent, including trivial and non-trivial instruction execution.
