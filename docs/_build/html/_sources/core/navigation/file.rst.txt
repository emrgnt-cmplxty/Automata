File
====

``File`` is a class that embodies a file in a hierarchical tree
structure.

Overview
--------

``File`` is positioned within the ``automata.core.navigation.directory``
module of the Automata Library. It acts as a symbol that stands for a
file in a tree-like directory structure. This class gets instantiated
with a name and an optional parent node. It inherits properties and
behavior from the ``Node`` class.

Related Symbols
---------------

-  ``automata.core.navigation.directory.Node``

Examples
--------

The following example demonstrates how to create an instance of
``File``.

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.navigation.directory import File, Node

   root = Node('root')
   file = File('file1', parent=root)

In this example, ‘file1’ is a ``File`` instance that is a child of the
‘root’ node.

Limitations
-----------

While the ``File`` class provides an abstract representation of a file
in a directory tree, it does not provide functionalities associated with
the actual file systems such as reading, writing or performing other I/O
operations on the file. It does not possess any understanding or context
of the contents of the actual file represented.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Can the ``File`` class be extended to include methods for interacting
   with the actual file system?
-  How does the ``File`` class interact with other components of the
   Automata Library?
