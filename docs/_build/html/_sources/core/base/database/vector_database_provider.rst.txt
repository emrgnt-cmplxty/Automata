VectorDatabaseProvider
======================

Overview
--------

The ``VectorDatabaseProvider`` is an abstract base class for different
types of vector database providers. These providers are responsible for
managing databases holding vector data. They have various methods that
need to be implemented in the concrete classes inheriting from the
``VectorDatabaseProvider``.

Example
-------

As ``VectorDatabaseProvider`` is an abstract base class, an instance of
it cannot be created. However, its methods can be implemented by
inheriting this class. One of the example concrete classes is
``JSONSymbolEmbeddingVectorDatabase``

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.symbol_embedding.base import JSONSymbolEmbeddingVectorDatabase

   class ExampleVectorDatabase(JSONSymbolEmbeddingVectorDatabase):
       def __init__(self, file_path: str):
           super().__init__(file_path)

       # Implement all the abstract methods required by the parent class
       # The methods signature should be same as that in VectorDatabaseProvider

Limitations
-----------

The primary limitation of the ``VectorDatabaseProvider`` base class is
that it does not provide any concrete implementations of the methods.
The specific implementations for vector database operations are deferred
to the classes that inherit it. It is essential to understand that each
concrete class may have its own limitations depending on the implemented
data source or methodology.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  How can we ensure efficient implementation of the abstract methods
   across different classes inheriting ``VectorDatabaseProvider``?
-  Are there some implementations of ``VectorDatabaseProvider`` which
   are specifically optimized for specific types of vector data or
   specific data sources?
