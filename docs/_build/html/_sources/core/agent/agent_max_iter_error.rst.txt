AgentMaxIterError
=================

``AgentMaxIterError`` is an exception class in automata.core.agent.error
module that is raised when an agent exceeds the maximum number of
iterations during its execution.

Overview
--------

``AgentMaxIterError`` can be used to handle errors when the execution of
an agent’s tasks doesn’t complete within the maximum number of
iterations allowed by the agent’s configuration. This prevents the agent
from being stuck in an infinite loop if a task isn’t producing the
expected results or isn’t reaching completion.

-  ``automata.config.base.AgentConfigBuilder.with_max_iterations``
-  ``automata.core.agent.error.AgentStopIteration``

Example
-------

The ``AgentMaxIterError`` can be used to gracefully handle exceptions
when running an agent. Here is an illustrative example:

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.agent.error import AgentMaxIterError
   from automata.core.agent.providers import OpenAIAutomataAgent
   from automata.config.base import AgentConfigBuilder

   # Instantiate a config builder and set max_iterations
   config_builder = AgentConfigBuilder()
   config_builder = config_builder.with_max_iterations(5)

   # Instantiate an agent with the above configuration
   my_agent = OpenAIAutomataAgent("Instructions to the agent", config_builder.build())

   # Run the agent and catch the exception if it exceeds maximum iterations
   try:
       my_agent.run()
   except AgentMaxIterError:
       print("The agent has exceeded the maximum number of iterations allowed.")

Limitations
-----------

One of the limitations of the ``AgentMaxIterError`` is that it depends
on the maximum number of iterations set in the agent configuration. If
the maximum iterations are set too high, it could result in an agent
running for an excessively long time before the error is raised.
Conversely, if it’s set too low, normal processes might be prematurely
interrupted by the error.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  How is the ideal maximum number of iterations determined for
   different types of agents?
-  How will the system behave if the maximum number of iterations isn’t
   set in the agent configuration?

assumptions might have been made. For example, it’s assumed that ‘agent’
mentioned in the docstrings refers to instances of
``OpenAIAutomataAgent``.*
