EmbeddingVectorProvider
=======================

``EmbeddingVectorProvider`` is an abstract base class that provides a
way to create embedding vectors for specified symbols in the automata
library. This vector provider returns vector embeddings in numpy array
format, which get utilized in both the OpenAI API and the internal
automata embedding layer.

Overview
--------

As an abstract base class, ``EmbeddingVectorProvider`` doesn’t provide a
specific implementation. Instead, it defines a standardized interface
for all types of embedding vector providers. These providers process
symbols to convert them into embedding vectors. The class mainly defines
one method, ``build_embedding_vector``, which needs to be implemented by
any subclasses.

Key symbols in relation to ``EmbeddingVectorProvider`` include
``EmbeddingBuilder``, ``OpenAIEmbeddingProvider``,
``JSONSymbolEmbeddingVectorDatabase``, ``SymbolCodeEmbedding``, and
associated unit testing files.

Related Symbols
---------------

-  ``automata.core.embedding.base.EmbeddingBuilder``
-  ``automata.core.llm.providers.openai.OpenAIEmbeddingProvider``
-  ``automata.core.symbol_embedding.base.JSONSymbolEmbeddingVectorDatabase``
-  ``automata.core.symbol_embedding.base.SymbolCodeEmbedding``
-  ``automata.tests.unit.test_symbol_embedding``

Example
-------

``EmbeddingVectorProvider`` is an abstract base class and is thus not
directly usable. However, library classes that make use of
``EmbeddingVectorProvider`` (for example, the ``EmbeddingBuilder`` or
``OpenAIEmbeddingProvider``), provide more concrete examples of usage.
Here is an example involving the ``OpenAIEmbeddingProvider``:

.. code:: python

   from automata.core.llm.providers.openai import OpenAIEmbeddingProvider

   embed_provider = OpenAIEmbeddingProvider()

   symbol_source = "Text from which to generate the embedding"
   embedding_vector = embed_provider.build_embedding_vector(symbol_source)

This example requires proper configuration of the OpenAI API and
importing the required objects.

Limitations
-----------

The primary limitations of ``EmbeddingVectorProvider`` stem from it
being an abstract base class. It does not provide a practical
implementation by itself. Also, the extent to which it can generate
effective embeddings heavily depends on the algorithms and libraries
used in the implementation of its subclasses.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  In testing cases where ``EmbeddingVectorProvider`` is used, it seems
   that mock examples are being used. Are there certain assumptions or
   configurations that should be considered when designing tests for it,
   considering that it’s a mock object?
-  Are there specific providers that are known to perform better or
   worse with certain types of symbols or classes? If so, are there ways
   to optimize these situations?
