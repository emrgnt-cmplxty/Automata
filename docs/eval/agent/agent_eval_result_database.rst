1. SQLite databases are typically used in this context because they are
   lightweight, requiring minimal setup and configuration, and are
   embedded within the application, eliminating the need for a separate
   server process. This makes SQLite databases ideal for local storage
   and testing environments. However, for a production environment or
   for larger scale applications, it might be necessary to support more
   robust databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL. The decision would largely
   depend on the specific requirements of the project.

2. Making the table schema dynamic could indeed provide greater
   flexibility. However, this also introduces greater complexity and
   potential for inconsistencies, especially if different instances or
   versions of the application attempt to write different schemas to the
   same database. Additionally, changing the schema after data has
   already been written could result in data loss or corruption.
   Therefore, itâ€™s important to carefully consider the specific needs
   and tradeoffs of the project before deciding to implement a dynamic
   schema.

3. Persisting the database file path in memory could make using the
   ``AgentEvalResultDatabase`` class more convenient in some situations.
   However, this would also make the class stateful, which could lead to
   unexpected behavior in certain scenarios. For example, if the
   application were to crash and restart, or if multiple instances of
   the class were being used concurrently, the stored path might not be
   what the user expects. As with the above points, whether to store the
   path in memory depends on the specific needs and tradeoffs of the
   project.
