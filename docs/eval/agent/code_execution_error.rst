-  To provide more description of the error when raising a
   ``CodeExecutionError``, you could customize the message given when
   the error is raised. For example, if a ``NameError`` occurs during
   execution, you might raise a ``CodeExecutionError`` with a message
   that further details this case. E.g.
   ``raise CodeExecutionError("Code execution failed due to an undefined variable.") from e``.
   Additionally, you could create subclasses of ``CodeExecutionError``
   that cover specific error cases (e.g., ``UndefinedVariableError``,
   ``SyntaxError``), each with their own custom messages.

-  The specific list of errors that should raise a
   ``CodeExecutionError`` would depend on the context and application.
   Generally, any errors that occur specifically during code execution,
   and can not be classified under a more specific error, could
   potentially raise a ``CodeExecutionError``. This could include, but
   is not limited to, ``SyntaxError``, ``TypeError``, ``ValueError``,
   ``NameError``, and ``AttributeError``. Itâ€™s important to note that
   the exception handling logic should be specific enough to handle
   different types of errors appropriately and not unnecessarily broadly
   use ``CodeExecutionError``.
