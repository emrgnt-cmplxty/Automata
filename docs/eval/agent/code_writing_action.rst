CodeWritingAction
=================

Overview
--------

``CodeWritingAction`` is a concrete implementation of the abstract
``Action`` class that represents a code-writing action performed by a
language model. This action essentially captures the instance of the
written Python code by the model. The class also includes mechanisms for
checking the equality of two instances of ``CodeWritingAction``, hashing
the instances, and converting the actions to and from Payload format for
easy serialization and deserialization.

Example
-------

Given below is an example script demonstrating how to create an instance
of a CodeWritingAction.

.. code:: python

   from automata.eval.agent.code_writing_eval import CodeWritingAction

   py_object = "x = 1"
   error = None
   action = CodeWritingAction(py_object=py_object, error=error)

   # using the methods
   payload = action.to_payload()  # converting action into a payload
   same_action = CodeWritingAction.from_payload(payload)  # and then recreating the same action from the payload
   assert action == same_action  # checks equality of the original and recreated actions

Limitations
-----------

Notwithstanding its significant utility, the ``CodeWritingAction`` class
is not without its limitations. The current implementation of the
``CodeWritingAction`` assumes that the code represented is Python code
only. Therefore, the use of this class for other programming languages
may need additional constraints or checks to guarantee correctness.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Is it possible to extend ``CodeWritingAction`` to handle other
   languages besides Python? If so, what potential issues might be
   encountered?
-  How does ``CodeWritingAction`` handle multiline Python scripts? Are
   there any problems related to encoding and decoding such scripts?
