-  ``VariableNotFoundError`` does not have specific logging or reporting
   methods to aid in identifying the source of the error. However, the
   error message itself usually comes with the line code that caused the
   problem and this could help in identifying the source of the problem.

-  To prevent ``VariableNotFoundError`` from being raised, it is key to
   ensure all variables are properly initialized and declared before
   they are used. Code review checkpoints and appropriate testing can
   also prevent this error.

-  The ``VariableNotFoundError`` is often raised by the interpreter when
   a piece of code is trying to access an undefined variable. This
   usually happens due to mistakes in code writing, when a particular
   variable is referenced before it is defined, or when itâ€™s out of
   scope. Understanding the control flow and correctly structuring the
   code can help in minimizing such errors.
