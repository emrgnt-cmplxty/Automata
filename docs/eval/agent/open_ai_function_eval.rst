-  Yes, ``OpenAIFunctionEval`` is designed to be extensible and can be
   subclassed to handle other types of actions. However, doing so would
   require careful design to ensure that the additional functionality
   does not break the existing functionality and conforms to the
   expected behavior of the parent class and other existing subclasses.

-  In a standard interaction in the ``OpenAIAutomataAgent``, messages
   are received and passed to the ``OpenAIFunctionEval`` object to
   extract the pertinent actions. These actions are then passed to the
   respective handlers within the agent to be executed. This allows for
   a clean separation of concerns within the agent, ensuring modularity
   and maintainability of the code.

-  If there are any errors or exceptions while extracting function call
   actions, ``OpenAIFunctionEval`` logs them and returns an empty list.
   This means that in these circumstances no action can be taken.
   Additional error handling could potentially be implemented in the
   future to attempt recovery or provide more detailed error information
   depending on system requirements.
