-  Yes, in some cases, there may be more specific exceptions that can be
   used instead of ``EvalExecutionError``. For instance, if an exception
   occurs specifically during the execution of code,
   ``CodeExecutionError`` would be more appropriate. Therefore, while
   ``EvalExecutionError`` can act as a broad exception for any type of
   execution error, it should not replace more specific exceptions that
   would provide more detailed information about the error.

-  As for handling ``EvalExecutionError`` within the automata
   environment, the best practices would largely depend on the specific
   context and the error-handling strategy decided for the application.
   However, some general recommendations would include:

   -  Catching and logging the exception information for debugging
      purposes. This can provide valuable insights and help in
      identifying the root cause of the error.
   -  For errors that can be handled gracefully, appropriate error
      handling logic should be added. This could be retry attempts,
      defaulting to a different task execution strategy, or even
      notifying the user about the issue.
   -  For errors that cannot be handled, it would be a best practice to
      fail fast and propagate the exception up the call stack. This can
      help in avoiding any further execution of tasks with an incorrect
      state. Please keep in mind, these are broad guidelines and the
      appropriate strategy can vary based on the specific use cases.
