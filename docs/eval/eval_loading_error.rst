I’m sorry for the confusion, but the information about the
``EvalLoadingError`` and related symbols seems to be hypothetical or
from a private or hypothetical source code that doesn’t have publicly
available documentation. It’s a common practice in Python programming to
define custom exceptions for specific error handling. In this context,
``EvalLoadingError`` appears to be a custom exception designed to handle
errors specifically occurred during the evaluation loading process in an
undefined ‘Automata’ project. However, without specific source code or
documentation, I’m unable to provide the exact answers to your follow-up
questions.
