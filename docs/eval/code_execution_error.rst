1. ``CodeExecutionError`` is used in the Automata platform during the
   code writing evaluation process. If there are any issues with the
   execution of the code written by the language model, this error will
   be raised. This helps in understanding and troubleshooting the
   performance and capabilities of a language model in terms of writing
   functional code.

2. Currently, ``CodeExecutionError`` does not provide any additional
   information, other than indicating that an error occurred during code
   execution. For better debugging and troubleshooting, it could be
   beneficial to add additional attributes to provide more context about
   where and why the error occurred. Some potential attributes can
   include:

   -  ``code_snippet``: The piece of code that caused the error.
   -  ``line_number``: The line number where the error occurred.
   -  ``error_type``: The type of the error (SyntaxError, ValueError,
      etc.)
   -  ``error_message``: A detailed message describing the error.
      Implementing these attributes can make it easier for developers
      working with the Automata platform to understand and rectify any
      issues that may arise during the code execution process. However,
      the implementation would need to consider privacy and security
      aspects, ensuring no sensitive data is exposed through error
      messages.
