1. Whether there’s a need for more specialized exception classes to
   handle different types of errors during an execution evaluation
   depends on the complexity of the execution process and the system’s
   needs regarding error handling. If having more specific error classes
   would help in identifying and resolving issues quickly, then it could
   be beneficial to have them.

2. ``EvalExecutionError`` is used in conjunction with other exception
   classes in the system to denote specific types of errors. Guidelines
   or strategies for using one exception type over another usually
   center around the principle of specificity: use the most specific
   exception type that accurately describes the error at hand. This
   enables efficient error handling and debugging. If an error does not
   fit any of the more specific exception classes, then a more general
   type, like ``EvalExecutionError``, might be used.
