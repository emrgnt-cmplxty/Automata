SymbolCodeEmbeddingHandler
==========================

``SymbolCodeEmbeddingHandler`` is a class that manages a database of
source code embeddings for ``Symbol`` instances. It comes equipped with
methods to process, update, queue and build embeddings in batches for
efficient handling.

Overview
--------

The ``SymbolCodeEmbeddingHandler`` class extends
``SymbolEmbeddingHandler``. This class is dedicated to handling the
embedding of source code symbols. After initializing with a provided
embeddable database, an embedding builder, and a batch size, the class
allows for the processing and updating of these embeddings. Depending on
whether the symbol source code has changed or not, the class either
updates existing embeddings or queues them for building. The batches of
updated or newly built embeddings can then be flushed to the database.

Related Symbols
---------------

Given the context, the related symbols cannot be determined. However, it
is understood that the ``SymbolCodeEmbeddingHandler`` class is likely a
part of an object-oriented structure where related classes or symbols
exist.

Usage Example
-------------

Note: The usage example assumes that the relevant modules, classes, and
functions defined in the module where ``SymbolCodeEmbeddingHandler``
resides are already imported.

.. code:: python

   from automata.memory_store.symbol_code_embedding_handler import SymbolCodeEmbeddingHandler
   from automata.memory_store.vector_database_provider import VectorDatabaseProvider
   from automata.memory_store.symbol_code_embedding_builder import SymbolCodeEmbeddingBuilder
   from automata.models.symbol import Symbol

   embedder_db_provider = VectorDatabaseProvider(<database parameters>)
   embedder_builder = SymbolCodeEmbeddingBuilder(<builder parameters>)
   handler = SymbolCodeEmbeddingHandler(embedder_db_provider,embedder_builder)

   # assuming symbols is a list of Symbol instances
   for symbol in symbols:
       handler.process_embedding(symbol)

   # Once the embeddings have been processed, we can flush them to the database
   handler.flush()

The above script initializes a ``SymbolCodeEmbeddingHandler`` instance
and processes a list of ``Symbol`` instances for embedding. The embedder
database provider and builder are initialized with hypothetical
parameters ``<database parameters>`` and ``<builder parameters>``, These
need to be filled in with actual parameters based on your
implementation.

Limitations
-----------

``SymbolCodeEmbeddingHandler`` requires a database provider
(``VectorDatabaseProvider``) and an embedding builder
(``SymbolCodeEmbeddingBuilder``). It cannot operate without these, so
the absence or failure of these dependencies is a limiting factor for
``SymbolCodeEmbeddingHandler``. Additionally, the current batch
implementation might cause some delay when dealing with large datasets
as the system needs to wait until a batch has been completely populated
for processing.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  What are the consequences if a ``Symbol`` instance does not have
   source code attached?
-  How are VectorDatabaseProvider and SymbolCodeEmbeddingBuilder used in
   the context of SymbolCodeEmbeddingHandler?
-  What are the typical sizes for a batch, and what are the implications
   of setting it too high or too low?
-  What is the specific use case or problem that this class is solving?
   It might help clarify its role within the larger system.
