The support for creating embeddings for batch sizes > 1 would be
dependent upon the methods and tools that the specific codebase
provides. If the particular project this class is from supports a batch
processing approach, it is likely that this would be possible. However,
the limitation specified for this class suggests that the batch size is
restricted to 1. Therefore, another handling approach or class would
likely be needed to process larger batch sizes.

For the second question, the provision to support more ways of
initiating embedding_builder would greatly depend on whether there were
more subclasses of SymbolEmbeddingBuilder that could be used as
alternatives to ``SymbolDocEmbeddingBuilder``. For instance, if there
were various kinds of embedding builders for different kinds of symbols,
then it would be reasonable to expand the functionality of the handler
to accommodate these different builders. However, it would likely
require significant modification of the ``SymbolDocEmbeddingHandler``
class to allow for different kinds of embedding builder objects to be
used. If the project’s architecture allows the creation or utilization
of different symbol embedding builders, it could be a potential
enhancement. Still, it’s important to note the specificity of the task
at hand which is processing embeddings for Python symbols from source
code - a task well suited for ``SymbolDocEmbeddingBuilder``.
