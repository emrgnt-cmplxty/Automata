-  Currently, the ``SymbolDocEmbeddingHandler`` only updates the symbol
   commit hash and source code, without changing the existing embedding.
   The addition of more functionalities for updating the existing
   embedding has not been mentioned, but it could be a useful feature to
   include in future iterations, especially as the source code could
   change over time, implying a change in the symbol’s meaning too.
-  At the moment, the ``SymbolDocEmbeddingHandler`` only supports a
   batch size of 1. There could be plans to support different batch
   sizes in the future, but this is not specified. The batch size could
   affect the speed and memory usage of the model, so it’s an aspect
   worth considering.
-  If there is no source code available for a symbol, the current
   implementation raises a ``ValueError``. Handling cases where source
   code is not available might entail providing a placeholder or default
   value, or skipping those particular symbols in the processing.
-  If the source code within a symbol is incorrect or faulty, it’s not
   clearly specified how the ``SymbolDocEmbeddingHandler`` would handle
   that. A robust system should ideally have some error-checking or
   validation mechanisms to handle such scenarios. However, such details
   were not mentioned and might depend on how the symbols are generally
   created and how reliable that process is.
