SymbolEmbedding
===============

``SymbolEmbedding`` is an abstract class for creating and managing
symbol code embeddings. This class is used to embed symbols into a high
dimensional space and provides helper functions to manage these embedded
representations in efficient ways. It extends the ``Embedding`` class
and specifies certain features required for handling symbol
representations.

Key attributes of this class include ``key``, ``document``, and
``vector``. The ``key`` attribute represents the unique identifier for
the symbol. The ``document`` attribute refers to the document where the
symbol was found. The ``vector`` attribute represents the vectorized
form of the symbol.

Overview
--------

``SymbolEmbedding`` allows the creation of an embedding of a symbol,
storing useful information like where the symbol was found and its
vector representation. It also contains properties for easy access to
core attributes such as ``symbol`` and ``metadata``.

In addition, ``SymbolEmbedding`` can be tailored and created directly
from given arguments using the ``from_args`` class method.

Example
-------

The following example demonstrates how to create an instance of
``SymbolEmbedding`` using valid argument values.

.. code:: python

   from automata.symbol_embedding.symbol_embedding_base import SymbolEmbedding
   import numpy as np

   symbol_key = 'exampleSymbol'
   document = 'exampleDocument.txt'
   vector = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5])

   symbol_embedding = SymbolEmbedding(symbol_key, document, vector)

Limitations
-----------

One of the main limitations of ``SymbolEmbedding`` is that it relies
heavily on the definition of the ``metadata`` property. Since
``metadata`` is an abstract method, any sub-class of ``SymbolEmbedding``
must provide its own implementation of this method.

Another limitation is that the structure of a symbolâ€™s vector
representation is not enforced. This relies on the user to ensure they
are creating consistent and meaningful vector representations.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  What is the ideal dimensionality or structure of a symbols vector
   representation?
-  How is the metadata for a specific symbol defined and used in the
   representation?
-  If a large number of symbols are embedded, how would memory and
   computation constraints be managed?
