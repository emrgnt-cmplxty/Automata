SymbolEmbeddingHandler
======================

Overview
--------

``SymbolEmbeddingHandler`` is an abstract base class that provides
handling of symbol embeddings. This class is designed to filter, fetch,
and process symbol embeddings that are required to build and retrieve
complex vector representations (embeddings) of symbols. A ``Symbol``
represents distinct logic, such as a python class, method or local
variable, along with a unique URI, typically in software applications.

``SymbolEmbeddingHandler``, in its derived classes, handles embedding of
symbol documents and symbol code, using a vector database to store and
retrieve these embeddings.

Example
-------

The following example demonstrates how to use SymbolEmbeddingHandler:

As it’s an abstract base class, you cannot make an instance of this
class directly. But, you can subclass it and provide concrete methods.

.. code:: python

   from automata.symbol.base import Symbol
   from automata.core.base.database.vector import VectorDatabaseProvider
   from automata.embedding.base import EmbeddingBuilder
   from automata.symbol_embedding.handler import SymbolEmbeddingHandler

   class MySymbolEmbeddingHandler(SymbolEmbeddingHandler):
       def process_embedding(self, symbol: Symbol):
           # add your embedding process here
           pass

   # create instances of necessary classes
   symbol = Symbol.from_string("scip-python python automata 75482692a6fe30c72db516201a6f47d9fb4af065 `automata.tools.base`/ToolNotFoundError#__init__().")
   vector_database = VectorDatabaseProvider()  # replace with a concrete implementaion of VectorDatabaseProvider
   embedding_builder = EmbeddingBuilder()  # replace with a concrete implementaion of EmbeddingBuilder

   handler = MySymbolEmbeddingHandler(vector_database, embedding_builder)
   handler.process_embedding(symbol)  # this will call your own process_embedding implementation

Limitations
-----------

The primary limitation comes from the abstract nature of this class. As
it lacks concrete implementation, it must be subclassed and its abstract
methods must be implemented before use. It also relies on the presence
of ordered entries in the embedding database, which means the embedding
database must support such functionality.

Further, it assumes that every symbol has a dotpath representation that
can be used to fetch the symbol embedding from the database. If a symbol
doesn’t have a dotpath representation or the database doesn’t have the
corresponding entry, it won’t return the correct embedding.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  What needs to be done to accommodate symbols that do not have a
   dotpath representation, or to populate the database with symbols that
   lack corresponding entries?
-  How robust is the symbol filtering mechanism? Could there be
   performance or accuracy issues when handling extensive or complex
   symbol batches?
-  Is it possible to handle symbols and their embeddings that don’t
   conform to the typical structure, such as those with multiple or
   nested dotpaths?
-  In the base ``EmbeddingHandler``, what kind of expectations does the
   class have on the structure and format of vector representations for
   embeddings?
