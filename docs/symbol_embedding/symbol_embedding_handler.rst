1. The ``batch_size`` parameter impacts the efficiency of embedding
   operations. Larger batch sizes mean that more embeddings are
   processed at once, which can provide a significant performance boost
   due to the reduction in individual operations. However, larger batch
   sizes also consume more memory, which could lead to issues if the
   available memory is limited.

2. As far as threading issues are concerned, it will depend on the
   specific implementation. ``SymbolEmbeddingHandler`` itself does not
   take care of thread safety and concurrency problems. Therefore, if
   multiple threads make changes to the same embeddings simultaneously,
   itâ€™s possible that there could be race conditions and data
   inconsistency. Therefore, any multi-threaded use of this handler
   should come with appropriate synchronization mechanisms to protect
   against concurrency issues.

3. The handler should be integrated into larger systems through classes
   that handle symbols, such as ``SymbolDocEmbeddingHandler``,
   ``SymbolCodeEmbeddingHandler``, etc. These classes will call the
   ``process_embedding`` method when new symbols are added, updated, or
   removed and the associated embeddings need to be changed. When any
   batch operation is finished, they should call ``flush`` to make sure
   all changes have been saved to the underlying database. Beyond this,
   the integration will depend on the specifics of the larger system.
   For instance, the system may have scheduler or a main loop where
   embedding operations are scheduled or triggered, or it may have
   callbacks or observers that notify the handler of changes to symbols.
