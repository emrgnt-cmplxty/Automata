SymbolCodeEmbeddingBuilder
==========================

``SymbolCodeEmbeddingBuilder`` is a class in the
automata.symbol_embedding.symbol_embedding_builders module. It’s
primarily used for generating source code embeddings for a given symbol.

Overview
--------

``SymbolCodeEmbeddingBuilder`` contains two methods: ``build`` and
``batch_build``. The ``build`` method generates the embedding for a
symbol’s source code, and the ``batch_build`` method generates the
embeddings for a list of symbols’ source code.

The class inherits from the ``EmbeddingBuilder`` and is instrumental in
building the ``SymbolCodeEmbedding``, which consists of the symbol, its
source code, and the corresponding embedding vector.

-  ``symbol_representation.symbol_code_embedding.SymbolCodeEmbedding``
-  ``embedding_provider.EmbeddingProvider``
-  ``symbol_embedding.EmdeddingBuilder``

Example
-------

The following example demonstrates building a ``SymbolCodeEmbedding``:

.. code:: python

   from automata.symbol_embedding.symbol_embedding_builders import SymbolCodeEmbeddingBuilder
   from symbol_representation.symbol import Symbol
   from symbol_representation.symbol_code_embedding import SymbolCodeEmbedding

   symbol_code = "def hello_world(): print('Hello, world!')"
   symbol = Symbol('hello_world', symbol_code)
   embedding_builder = SymbolCodeEmbeddingBuilder()

   # Building SymbolCodeEmbedding for a single symbol
   symbol_code_embedding = embedding_builder.build(symbol_code, symbol)
   print(symbol_code_embedding)

   # Building SymbolCodeEmbedding for a batch of symbols
   symbol_codes = [symbol_code, symbol_code]
   symbols = [symbol, symbol]
   symbol_code_embeddings = embedding_builder.batch_build(symbol_codes, symbols)
   print(symbol_code_embeddings)

Limitations
-----------

``SymbolCodeEmbeddingBuilder`` does not handle symbols that are not
identifiable in the source code, like variables or symbols from imported
modules. Ensuring that the source code passed to the ``build`` or
``batch_build`` methods contains the defined symbol is crucial for
proper functionality.

In addition, the actual implementation of the ``EmbeddingBuilder`` and
``EmbeddingProvider`` is not shown in the context, so assumptions have
been made in the example provided. Depending on the specific
implementations of those classes, additional set-up may be required.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Are there specific requirements or best practice guidelines for
   source code passed to this builder class?
-  How are symbols that are not defined in the provided source code
   handled?
