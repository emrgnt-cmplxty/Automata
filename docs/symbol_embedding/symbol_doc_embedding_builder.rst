-  Would it be possible to add an optional parameter to the ``build``
   method to control the level of detail included in the resulting
   ``SymbolDocEmbedding`` object, i.e., full details vs.Â summary view?
-  How is the accuracy or correctness of the generated
   ``SymbolDocEmbedding`` object quantified or evaluated? Could there be
   any metrics or methods that provide insights into the quality of the
   generated embeddings?
-  Is it possible to fine-tune or customize the underlying machine
   learning models used for generating documentation embeddings? If yes,
   could you describe how it could be done?
-  Apart from IntelliSense and API documentation generation, could you
   provide other examples of practical applications that might benefit
   from using ``SymbolDocEmbeddingBuilder``?
-  How are versions and compatibility of underlying machine learning
   models managed in the context of this class?
-  Can the encoded ``SymbolDocEmbedding`` be easily decoded into a
   human-readable format? What needs to be done to decode an embedded
   object?
