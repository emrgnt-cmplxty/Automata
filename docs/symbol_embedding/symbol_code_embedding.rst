1. What metadata is expected for ``SymbolCodeEmbedding``?

   -  The metadata for ``SymbolCodeEmbedding`` is expected to be the
      information about the data being processed, such as the name of
      the document or code that the symbol was extracted from, and other
      related information that might be useful in understanding the
      context of the symbol or the embedding in a larger project or
      system.

2. Is the current method implementation as expected?

   -  As the details about the method implementation are not completely
      mentioned itâ€™s difficult to comment on this. However, in general,
      the method implementation would largely depend on how
      ``SymbolCodeEmbedding`` is being used in the project. If the
      method is not returning the expected results or expected behavior
      then it might need to be re-looked at or debugged for
      improvements.
