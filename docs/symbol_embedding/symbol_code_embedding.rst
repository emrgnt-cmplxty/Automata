SymbolCodeEmbedding
===================

``SymbolCodeEmbedding`` is a concrete class used for creating embeddings
for source code symbols. It is part of the
``automata.symbol_embedding.base`` package.

Overview
--------

``SymbolCodeEmbedding`` is used to embed source code symbols in an
N-dimensional space. It inherits from ``SymbolEmbedding``, which is an
abstract class for symbol code embeddings. The class mainly has a
constructor for initialization and a ``__str__`` method which returns a
string representation of the object.

Related Symbols
---------------

-  ``automata.symbol_embedding.builders.SymbolCodeEmbeddingBuilder``: A
   class that builds ``Symbol`` source code embeddings.
-  ``automata.memory_store.symbol_code_embedding.SymbolCodeEmbeddingHandler``:
   Handles a database for ``Symbol`` source code embeddings.
-  ``automata.core.base.database.vector.JSONVectorDatabase``: A class
   that provides the database for storing and retrieving the vector
   embeddings.
-  ``automata.symbol.base.Symbol``: A class which contains associated
   logic for a Symbol.

Example
-------

For creating an instance of ``SymbolCodeEmbedding``, you first need to
have a ``Symbol`` and a ``source_code`` associated with it. You also
need a numpy array for the vector representation. Below is an example:

.. code:: python

   from automata.symbol.base import Symbol
   from automata.symbol_embedding.base import SymbolCodeEmbedding
   import numpy as np

   symbol = Symbol("URIsymbol")
   source_code = "def test():\n\treturn"
   vector = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5])

   # Initialize SymbolCodeEmbedding
   embed = SymbolCodeEmbedding(symbol, source_code, vector)

   # Print the SymbolCodeEmbedding
   print(embed)

Limitations
-----------

There might limitations around the dimensionality of the numpy vector as
the complexity and size of source code symbols can impose storage and
computation issues.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  What is the dimension of the numpy vectors which are standard in this
   context?
-  How are the numpy vectors generated or trained from the source code?
-  Are there any implicit limitations or assumptions on the type of
   symbol or source code that can be embedded?
