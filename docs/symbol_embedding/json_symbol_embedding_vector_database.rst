-  The JSON file should be structured in a conventional format that
   includes a list of symbol embeddings and their associated hash keys.
   Any extra or irrelevant data may cause errors.
-  As ``JSONSymbolEmbeddingVectorDatabase`` is a simple JSON database
   implementation, it doesnâ€™t have stringent size limit requirements but
   efficiency can be a concern with very large datasets. For handling
   larger datasets, other forms of databases such as SQL or NoSQL might
   be more suitable.
-  The current implementation of ``JSONSymbolEmbeddingVectorDatabase``
   does not include specific provisions for handling concurrency or
   sharing across different processes. Any concurrent access needs to be
   handled at the application level.
-  The ``JSONSymbolEmbeddingVectorDatabase`` does not explicitly support
   transactional operations like commit and rollback. Any database
   failures might need to be manually handled or recovered by
   reinitializing from the source data. For more advanced operations
   like transactions, consider using more sophisticated databases like
   SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc. that inherently support transaction safety.
