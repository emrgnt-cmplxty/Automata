``IEmbeddingLookupProvider`` is a hypothetical interface, potentially
created in the context of a natural language processing or machine
learning application, such as in a chatbot or recommendation engine.
This interface may be meant to provide consistent, reusable
functionality for classes that need to convert their embeddings into a
hashable key. Here’s an illustrative usage:

.. code:: python

   class MyEmbeddingLookupProvider(IEmbeddingLookupProvider):
     def embedding_to_key(self, entry: SymbolEmbedding) -> str:
       # Implementation based on requirements
       pass

This class could be used by different components or services that need
to turn embeddings into a standardized key for further processing, for
example for retrieving previously stored embeddings or for comparison
against other embeddings. Different implementations of this interface
would handle the specifics of how the embedding would be converted into
a key based on the necessary requirements.

It’s important to note that without the concrete context, assumptions
have been made about the intended use and functionality of this
interface. The purpose, functionality, and usage could vary based on the
actual context where this interface is designed. Useful follow-up
information would be the actual code where ``IEmbeddingLookupProvider``
is defined or used. Also, information about the project or system
architecture could aid in providing a more accurate description.
