1. The BoundingBox essentially “approximates” complex, non-rectangular
   regions by defining the minimum and maximum coordinates in x and y
   that enclose the region. Therefore, it may not accurately reflect the
   actual area of such regions, and can lead to suboptimal decisions.
   There might be parts in the BoundingBox where there is no valid
   region. Special care and additional navigation constraints might be
   needed when dealing with such cases.

2. Typically, a BoundingBox is restricted to 2D space, representing an
   orthogonal rectangular box (parallelepiped) by convention. Inclusion
   of other dimensions, such as z for 3D space, is possible
   theoretically, but it is up to the implementation. However, including
   more dimensions might complicate decision-making and computation.

3. When a BoundingBox is given a node that does not have applicable
   attributes, it typically results in an error or exception as critical
   information is missing. In some implementations, it might return a
   default or null BoundingBox. It is generally good practice to check
   if the required attributes exist before constructing a BoundingBox.
