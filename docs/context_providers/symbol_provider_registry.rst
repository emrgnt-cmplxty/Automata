SymbolProviderRegistry
======================

Overview
--------

``SymbolProviderRegistry`` is a class for managing instances of
``ISymbolProvider`` objects. It provides methods for registering,
tracking, and synchronizing symbol providers across numerous parts of
the system. This class uses singleton design pattern, thus there is only
one unique ``SymbolProviderRegistry`` instance during the runtime. The
registry keeps track of two primary attributes: a set ``_providers`` of
all registered symbol providers, and a list ``sorted_supported_symbols``
of all symbols supported by every registered provider.

Related Symbols
---------------

-  ``automata.context_providers.symbol_synchronization_context.SymbolProviderSynchronizationContext.register_provider``
-  ``automata.context_providers.symbol_synchronization_context.SymbolProviderSynchronizationContext.synchronize``
-  ``automata.singletons.dependency_factory.DependencyFactory._synchronize_provider``
-  ``automata.symbol.symbol_base.ISymbolProvider``
-  ``automata.cli.scripts.run_doc_embedding.initialize_providers``

Usage Example
-------------

Synchronization of symbol providers and their supported symbols is an
important operation in application involving symbolic representations of
data. Here is an example of using ``SymbolProviderRegistry`` for
registering and synchronizing symbol providers:

.. code:: python

   from automata.context_providers.symbol_synchronization_context import SymbolProviderRegistry
   from your_module import SymbolProviderExample  # Assume this class implements ISymbolProvider interface

   provider_one = SymbolProviderExample()
   provider_two = SymbolProviderExample()

   SymbolProviderRegistry.register_provider(provider_one)
   SymbolProviderRegistry.register_provider(provider_two)

   SymbolProviderRegistry.synchronize()

   filtered_supported_symbols = SymbolProviderRegistry.get_sorted_supported_symbols()

In the above example, we first register ``provider_one`` and
``provider_two``. Subsequently, we synchronize all registered providers
using ``synchronize()``. After synchronizing, we use
``get_sorted_supported_symbols()`` to retrieve the supported symbols,
which now includes only those symbols supported by all providers.

Limitations
-----------

``SymbolProviderRegistry`` imposes a common subset of symbols ideology
among all registered providers, leading to a situation where if there is
no common subset between them, an exception will be raised. This
approach might not be desirable for cases where it’s completely
acceptable to have providers with no overlapping symbols.

Furthermore, the functionality provided by this class is limited by the
correct implementation of ``ISymbolProvider``\ ’s methods by symbol
providers. If methods like ``set_synchronized``, ``filter_symbols``,
``_get_sorted_supported_symbols`` are not implemented correctly, the
``SymbolProviderRegistry`` may not operate as expected.

Lastly, it’s important to note that this class uses a Singleton pattern
and can only support one distinct instance of ``SymbolProviderRegistry``
during the system’s runtime.

Follow-up Questions
-------------------

-  How well does this class handle cases where there is a need to
   maintain different registries for different symbol providers?
-  How well can the synchronization mechanism handle future extensions
   to the ISymbolProvider interface, such as the addition of new
   initialization states?
-  What happens when a registered symbol provider does not implement the
   ISymbolProvider methods correctly? Are there sufficient error handle
   mechanisms in place to inform the user about potential issues caused
   by this?
