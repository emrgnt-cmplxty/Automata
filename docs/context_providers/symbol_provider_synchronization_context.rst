SymbolProviderSynchronizationContext
====================================

``SymbolProviderSynchronizationContext`` is a Python class designed to
manage synchronization tasks for symbol providers in the Automata
codebase. This context manager class ensures that symbol providers are
able to register and sync effectively to maintain expected code
performance and correctness in symbol processing procedures.

Overview
--------

``SymbolProviderSynchronizationContext`` manages the registration and
synchronization of symbol providers using context management protocol
methods ``__enter__`` and ``__exit__``. This class makes sure to raise
an exception when a symbol provider has not been synchronized within the
synchronization context.

This class provides two primary methods: - ``register_provider``:
Registers a symbol provider into ``SymbolProviderRegistry``. -
``synchronize``: Synchronizes all registered symbol providers in
``SymbolProviderRegistry``.

Usage Example
-------------

.. code:: python

   from automata.context_providers.symbol_synchronization_context import SymbolProviderSynchronizationContext

   # Assume `MySymbolProvider` is a class that implements the `ISymbolProvider` interface.
   my_provider = MySymbolProvider()

   with SymbolProviderSynchronizationContext() as sync_context:
       sync_context.register_provider(my_provider)
       # Attempt to register more providers (if any).
       sync_context.synchronize()    # Synchronize all registered providers.

Implementation Details and Limitations
--------------------------------------

-  The class uses an internal attribute ``_was_synchronized`` to keep
   track of whether symbol providers have been synchronized within the
   context. This design decision could limit the usability of the class
   in distributed scenarios. In such cases where multiple threads or
   processes are using the same context, race conditions might occur.
-  When ``__exit__`` is called, the class raises a ``RuntimeError`` if
   no synchronization of symbol providers has occurred. This means
   achieving graceful context exit relies on the client code to call
   ``synchronize`` method at least once before exiting the context.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  How can we better adapt ``SymbolProviderSynchronizationContext`` to
   multi-threaded or distributed applications?
-  With the current design, a ``RuntimeError`` is raised if providers
   are registered but not synchronized within the context. Could there
   be situations where this strict rule might be overbearing? How can we
   achieve more flexibility while maintaining effectiveness of the
   class?
-  Could there be a better alternative design for the
   ``register_provider`` and ``synchronize`` methods to ensure all
   symbol providers are always synchronized correctly after being
   registered?
