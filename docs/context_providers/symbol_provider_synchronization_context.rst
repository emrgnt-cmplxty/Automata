-  If symbol providers are not synchronized before exiting the context,
   it can cause inconsistent data representation among different symbol
   providers. This can potentially lead to errors and unexpected
   behavior of the software system that relies on these symbol
   providers. For example, a procedure might not see the latest
   modifications of a symbol or might incorrectly assume two symbols are
   identical when they arenâ€™t.

-  If a symbol provider does not implement ``ISymbolProvider``
   correctly, it may lead to a range of issues, especially when used in
   a ``SymbolProviderSynchronizationContext``. For instance, if the
   synchronization method is not implemented correctly, trying to
   synchronize the given provider could fail or produce an incorrect
   state. This can lead to inconsistencies in symbol representation,
   corruption of data, or unexpected runtime errors. It might also
   violate the dependencies and contracts between different parts of the
   code that rely on the symbol provider. Hence why proper
   implementation of the ``ISymbolProvider`` interface by each symbol
   provider is fundamental for the functioning of the system.
