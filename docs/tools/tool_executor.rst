-  The ``ToolExecutor`` is explicitly designed to work with objects that
   implements the ``IToolExecution`` interface. If other types of
   execution behavior interfaces are to be used, they would need to have
   a similar ``execute`` method that takes a ``FunctionCall`` object as
   an argument and returns a string.
-  As of the time of writing, it doesn’t look like there’s any explicit
   error handling or validation to ensure the ``IToolExecution``
   instance is valid. If the passed object does not correctly implement
   the ``IToolExecution`` interface, a Python ``TypeError`` will likely
   be raised when attempting to call its ``execute`` method.
-  In terms of limitations on the ``FunctionCall`` class, the most
   crucial point is that the ``name`` property should correspond to a
   valid tool in the agent’s repertoire, and the arguments should match
   the expected inputs for that tool. How these inputs are used will
   depend on the specifications of the tool being called. Therefore,
   it’s important to be familiar with the requirements of each specific
   tool.
