1. Yes, the Tool.Config can be potentially extended to suit specific use
   cases. It serves as a base configuration class and, if needed, you
   may further extend or customize it according to the needs of your
   specific tool. However, it would be prudent to ensure that the
   enhancements maintain the overall goal of the class, which is to
   provide a clean and maintainable configuration.

2. The implementation uses methods and directives offered by the
   underlying Pydantic library to design a model with these constraints.
   The Pydantic BaseModel class offers ways to set configuration
   attributes that control these characteristics.

3. While it’s true that there may be scenarios where allowing extra
   attributes would beneficial, it does pose a risk of a messy and
   uncontrolled configuration structure. Therefore, the Tool.Config
   class prioritizes ease of maintainability and simplicity by
   forbidding extra attributes. However, if a scenario demands extra
   attributes, a new derived class can be created from the base
   Tool.Config, where these requirements can be managed specifically.
   It’s important to be mindful of ensuring that this does not introduce
   unnecessary complexity.
