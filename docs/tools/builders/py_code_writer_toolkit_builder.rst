1. Code validation can be introduced in ``PyCodeWriterToolkitBuilder``
   using the ``ast.parse()`` function provided by Python’s built-in
   Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) module. This can be done before
   attempting to create or update a module. If ``ast.parse()`` raises a
   ``SyntaxError``, it signifies that the input python code is invalid.

2. A configuration option, perhaps as a boolean variable, can be
   introduced to the ``PyCodeWriterToolkitBuilder``. This option would
   determine whether or not to throw error when a module does not exist.
   The builder checks if the module exists, and if not, uses this
   configuration to decide if they should be created. If the config
   option is set to not create new modules, an error should be raised
   when a non-existent module is encountered.

3. Extending ``PyCodeWriterToolkitBuilder`` to handle other programming
   languages or generic text files would require building similar
   toolkit builders for those languages or files, as they would likely
   have unique syntax and specifications. However, this could greatly
   improve the versatility of the toolkits and broaden their areas of
   application. Note that building these systems could be complex, given
   the differences in syntax and semantics across programming languages.
   Design considerations would need to be made to ensure the tools
   retain a common interface while supporting different languages’
   specifics.
