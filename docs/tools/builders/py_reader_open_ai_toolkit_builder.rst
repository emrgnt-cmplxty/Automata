PyReaderOpenAIToolkitBuilder
============================

Overview
--------

``PyReaderOpenAIToolkitBuilder`` is a class that serves as a builder for
tools that aim to interact with Python-based resources. It extends
``PyReaderToolkitBuilder`` and ``OpenAIAgentToolkitBuilder`` classes,
providing the ability to build tools specifically for OpenAI interface.
The class produces a list of ``OpenAITool`` instances through its
``build_for_open_ai`` method. These tools carry information like
function they execute, their name, description, and the properties they
require for proper execution.

Each tool is initialized through the ``OpenAITool`` constructor and is
stored in the ``openai_tools`` list which is finally returned by the
``build_for_open_ai`` method. The toolsâ€™ properties are determined
through a fixed dictionary containing keys like ``module_path`` and
``node_path``, providing context for the code retrieval process.

Related Symbols
---------------

-  ``automata.tools.builders.py_reader_builder.PyReaderToolkitBuilder``
-  ``automata.tools.builders.openai_agent_toolkit_builder.OpenAIAgentToolkitBuilder``
-  ``automata.tools.tool.AgentToolkitNames``
-  ``automata.tools.provider.LLMProvider``
-  ``automata.tools.openai_tool.OpenAITool``

Usage Example
-------------

Below is an example of how to use ``PyReaderOpenAIToolkitBuilder`` to
build an OpenAI tool:

.. code:: python

   from automata.tools.builders.py_reader_builder import PyReaderOpenAIToolkitBuilder

   # Initialize the builder.
   builder = PyReaderOpenAIToolkitBuilder()

   # Build the OpenAI tools.
   openai_tools = builder.build_for_open_ai()

   # Let's print the details of the first tool for demonstrative purposes.
   first_tool = openai_tools[0]
   print(f"Tool name: {first_tool.name}")
   print(f"Tool description: {first_tool.description}")
   print(f"Tool required properties: {first_tool.required}")
   # Output can be specific to the build set-up and tools built.

Limitations
-----------

The primary limitation of ``PyReaderOpenAIToolkitBuilder`` is that the
parameters assigned while building ``OpenAITool`` instances are fixed -
``module_path`` is a required field, and ``node_path`` is an optional
field. This means ``PyReaderOpenAIToolkitBuilder`` may not be flexible
enough for all use cases where different types of parameters might be
needed.

Moreover, the ``build_for_open_ai`` method extensively relies on the
``build`` method of the parent ``PyReaderToolkitBuilder``. Any changes
or issues in the parent class or method would directly impact
``PyReaderOpenAIToolkitBuilder``.

Follow-up Questions:
--------------------

-  Is there a way to make ``PyReaderOpenAIToolkitBuilder`` more flexible
   in terms of the parameters it assigns while building ``OpenAITool``
   objects?
-  What is the type and nature of ``tool.function`` referenced inside of
   the ``build_for_open_ai`` method?
-  How can we potentially handle different configurations or extensions
   of this tool builder class to accommodate potential future needs or
   changes in the API?
