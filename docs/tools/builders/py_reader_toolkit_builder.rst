1. As of now, specific plans to extend the functionality of
   ``PyReaderToolkitBuilder`` to facilitate easier error handling
   haven’t been disclosed. However, development in the OpenAI codebase
   is ongoing, and enhancements may include better error handling.
   Please keep an eye on the OpenAI updates.

2. Even though it hasn’t been stated explicitly, the architecture of the
   tools builders classes in the OpenAI codebase encourages composition.
   ``PyReaderToolkitBuilder`` itself is part of a composition with
   ``PyReader``. So one can imagine integrating with other code parsing
   tools builders where common interfaces align. It’s up to your
   implementation and design as to how this could be achieved.

3. ``PyReaderToolkitBuilder`` should work will with any tool that uses
   the ``PythonIndexer`` API. Regarding compatibility requirements,
   given that ``PyReaderToolkitBuilder`` and related tools work heavily
   with Python indexing, retrieving and parsing, any module, or code you
   intend to work with should be compatible with the Python standards.
   Potential issues could arise from the inability to resolve relative
   imports or if code is written in a way that is not amenable to
   docstring extraction or code parsing. As ‘PyReaderToolkitBuilder’ can
   only read, it may not inherently modify or correct these parts of the
   code.
