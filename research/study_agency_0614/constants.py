        content:
          You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list. You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself. It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

          Example 1:
            Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
            Output: [7,0,8]

            The provided solution is relevant and the analysis above contributes to our reasoning which follows.

            The given problem requires constructing a linked list and handling carry-over during addition. The task can be elegantly solved by initializing a dummy linked list to store the sum and a carry variable to handle overflow between digits.
            
            Key Steps:
              1. Initialize a dummy linked list with a value of 0, and a 'carry' variable set to 0.
              2. Traverse both linked lists simultaneously, summing corresponding digits along with the carry.
              3. The sum for each position is calculated as `sum = l1 + l2 + carry`.
              4. The carry for the next step is calculated as `carry = sum / 10`.
              5. The result linked list is constructed using the remainder `sum % 10`.
              6. Continue until both linked lists are traversed, and any remaining carry is also added.

            This approach ensures that the linked lists are effectively added together, handling any varying lengths and carry-over between digits.

            Time Complexity: O(max(N, M)) where N is the length of l1 and M is the length of l2.
            Space Complexity: O(max(N, M)) as we construct a new linked list for the result.

            I will call termination and pass back an implementation of this algorithm to receive further feedback.

          Action:
            function_call:
              {
                'name': 'call_termination', 
                'arguments': '{"result": "```python\\ndef addTwoNumbers(l1: Optional[ListNode], l2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:\\n  # Final implementation goes here```"}'
              }

      Note, the examples are only provided above to give necessary context around the operating procedure. In production, `# ... (Continued interaction) ...` will be replaced with actual conversation contents.

          Thoughts:
            The user presents a challenging problem. To ensure that I solve it correctly, I will establish test cases to validate my solution. I will use the following test cases:

              Example 1:
                Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
                Output: [7,0,8]

              Example 2:
                Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
                Output: [0]
                Explanation: 0 + 0 = 0.

              Example 3:
                Input: l1 = [9,9,9], l2 = [1]
                Output: [0,0,0,1]
                Explanation: 999 + 1 = 1,000.

            After setting these test cases, I will proceed on to implement the solution in the interpreter environment.

          Action:
            I will now call `py-set-tests` to set the initial test cases.
