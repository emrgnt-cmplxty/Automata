# Agency Study: Human Evaluation Results

In this evaluation, various configurations of the LLMs, including GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, are assessed across different modes and techniques for problem solving. The analysis includes Zero-Shot learning, Vanilla Agents, and Advanced Agents, both with and without specific tools.

The following sections details the results, system prompts, instructions, and agent methodology. By exploring these facets, this simple analysis aims to provide a holistic view of the state of the art performance of the LLMs as agents.

## Results

The tabulated results showcase the performance of different configurations of the Large Language Models (LLMs) on the HumanEval dataset. Both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 versions are evaluated across various modes, including Zero-Shot, Vanilla Agent, and Advanced Agent, with and without specific tools. The asterisk (*) denotes imputed values, where malformatted prompts are replaced with Zero-Shot solutions, leading to improved performance in some cases. These results provide insights into the capabilities of the models and their ability to handle complex algorithmic challenges.

## Approach Overview

- **Zero-Shot Learning**: The zero-shot learning capabilities were assessed without any specific instructions or context. The models were expected to interpret and solve problems without prior exposure.

- **Vanilla Agent, No Tools**: With this approach an agent is given a simple set of instructions which inform the agent of it's advanced capabilities and the expected operating procedure. The agent is then expected to solve the problem without any additional tools.

- **Advanced Agent, Various Modes**: The advanced agent's results were divided into different modes, including those with and without the use of the Py-Interpreter tool. These modes allowed for more complex reasoning and validation of the solutions.

>     You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list. You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself. It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

>       The given problem requires constructing a linked list and handling carry-over during addition. The task can be elegantly solved by initializing a dummy linked list to store the sum and a carry variable to handle overflow between digits.
>       
>       Key Steps:
>         1. Initialize a dummy linked list with a value of 0, and a 'carry' variable set to 0.
>         2. Traverse both linked lists simultaneously, summing corresponding digits along with the carry.
>         3. The sum for each position is calculated as `sum = l1 + l2 + carry`.
>         4. The carry for the next step is calculated as `carry = sum / 10`.
>         5. The result linked list is constructed using the remainder `sum % 10`.
>         6. Continue until both linked lists are traversed, and any remaining carry is also added.
>
>       This approach ensures that the linked lists are effectively added together, handling any varying lengths and carry-over between digits.
>
>       Time Complexity: O(max(N, M)) where N is the length of l1 and M is the length of l2.
>       Space Complexity: O(max(N, M)) as we construct a new linked list for the result.
