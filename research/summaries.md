# Papers Summary

## Attention is All You Need

- **Link**: [PDF](./papers/attention_is_all_you_need.pdf)

- **Github**: https://github.com/jadore801120/attention-is-all-you-need-pytorch (Unofficial PyTorch implementation)

- **Summary**: The paper introduces the Transformer, a novel network architecture that entirely forgoes recurrence and convolutions, relying solely on attention mechanisms. This approach offers enhanced quality, parallelizability, and reduced training time. The Transformer architecture uses concepts like self-attention, multi-head attention, and positional encoding to capture dependencies in input sequences and sequence order, despite the absence of recurrent or convolutional layers. It's composed of encoder and decoder stacks, each containing multiple identical layers with sub-layers designed to perform specific functions. The innovative attention mechanisms include "Scaled Dot-Product Attention," which is computationally efficient and "Multi-Head Attention" that allows the model to attend to information from different representation subspaces. The Transformer also introduces positional encodings to the input embeddings to utilize the order of the sequence.

    The paper presents results that highlight the Transformer's superiority over previously reported models, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the WMT 2014 English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks. Various experiments and model variations further demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the Transformer, including its application to English constituency parsing. The Transformer's emphasis on attention mechanisms over recurrent connections has profound implications for various natural language processing tasks, including machine translation and parsing. By offering a faster training process and a model that can handle dependencies regardless of their positions in the input, the Transformer has become a foundational architecture in modern deep learning, with a wide range of applications beyond text, potentially extending to images, audio, and video.

## CodeBERT: A Pre-Trained Model for Programming and Natural Languages

- **Link**: [PDF](./papers/codebert.pdf)

- **Github**: https://github.com/microsoft/CodeBERT

- **Summary**: The paper on CodeBERT, a model pre-trained on both natural language and programming language data, offers insights into tasks like code search, code-to-documentation generation, and code-to-natural language (NL) generation. Utilizing the Transformer architecture, CodeBERT has been benchmarked against various models including RoBERTa, Transformer, and RNN-based models, showing superior performance in code-to-NL generation tasks. The research also explores the use of abstract syntax trees (AST), language generalization capabilities, and potential improvement areas such as generation-related learning objectives. The authors identify new research directions, including incorporating AST into pre-training, extending to more programming languages, and devising robust adaptation methods.
  
    In a detailed experiment, CodeBERT's effectiveness is assessed in natural language code retrieval and NL-programming language (PL) probing tasks. It outperforms other models, especially when initialized with RoBERTa parameters and further fine-tuned. The evaluation includes metrics like mean average precision at various levels (MA-AVG) across different languages. The probing task indicates that CodeBERT successfully bridges the gap between NL and PL, a key finding that underscores its promising potential in understanding and generating code snippets.

## LongCoder: A Long-Range Pre-trained Language Model for Code Completion

- **Link**: [PDF](./papers/longcoder.pdf)

- **Summary**: The paper introduces LongCoder, a novel sparse Transformer model designed for the code completion task, specifically focusing on handling long code inputs. LongCoder employs a sliding window mechanism and introduces two globally accessible tokens, bridge tokens and memory tokens, to facilitate local-global interaction and to highlight crucial statements. To tackle the computational complexity associated with modeling long code inputs in existing Transformer models, LongCoder reduces complexity to linear, making it more efficient for long code inputs. To validate its effectiveness, the authors created a new dataset called Long Code Completion (LCC), and LongCoder was found to outperform existing models while maintaining similar computational resources. The paper's contributions include the construction of the LCC dataset, proposing sparse attention types, and training LongCoder, which achieves superior performance on both long and regular code completion tasks.

    In the technical details, LongCoder uses three types of attention mechanisms: window attention for local context, bridge attention to access distant context, and global attention for identifiers with global scope. The paper introduces the Long Code Completion Benchmark (LCC) for Python, Java, and C#, and evaluates LongCoder against several pre-trained models and sparse Transformer models, including GPT-2, CodeGPT, and UniXcoder. LongCoder demonstrated effectiveness on both Exact Match (EM) and Edit Similarity (Edit Sim) metrics and achieved state-of-the-art performance on the CodeXGLUE code completion benchmarks. An ablation study further underscored the importance of each component in LongCoder, highlighting the model's potential in complex scenarios, such as cross-file code completion, and its advantage over existing solutions in handling long-range code sequences.
